excepting only the following "Permitted Encumbrances": restrictions and easements of record, and zoning ordinances (the terms
of which are and will be complied with, and in the case of easements, are and will be kept free of encrcachments), taxes and
assessments not yet due and payable and those Permitted Encumbrances set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto (except that if no
Exhibit B is attached, there will be no additional Permitted Encumbrances). The lien of this Deed of Trust, subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances, is and will continue to be a valid first and only lien upon all ofthe Mortgaged Property.
2.2 Maintenance; Waste; Alteration. The Grantor will maintain the Premises in good and tenantable condition and will restore
or replace damaged or destroyed improvements with items of at least equal utility and value. The Grantor will not commit or permit
waste to be committed on the Premises. The Grantor will not remove, demolish or materially alter any part ofthe Premises without
the Beneficiary’s prior written consent, except the Grantor may remove a fixture, provided the fixture is promptly replaced with
another fixture of at least equal utility. The replacement fixture will be subject to the priority lien and security of this Deed of Trust.
2.3 Transfer and Liens. The Grantor will not, without the prior written consent of the Beneficiary, which may be withheld in the
Beneficiary’s sole and absolute discretion, either voluntarily or involuntarily (a) sell, assign, lease or transfer, or permit to be sold,

Beneficiary designates, to pay (a) the estimated annual real estate taxes and assessments on the Premises; and (b) all property or
1714OR Page 2 of 8

hazard insurance premiums when due. Interest will not be paid by the Beneficiary on any escrowed funds unless otherwise required
by law. Escrowed funds may be ccmmingled with other funds of the Beneficiary. All escrowed funds are hereby pledged as
additional security for the Obligations.
2.5 Taxes, Assessments and Charges. To the extent not paid to the Beneficiary under 2.4 above, the Grantor will pay before
they become delinquent all ta><es, assessments and other charges now or hereafter levied or assessed against the Premises, against
the Beneficiary based upon this Deed of Trust or the Obligations secured by this Deed of Trust, or upon the Beneficiary's interest in
the Premises, and deliver to the Beneficiary receipts showing timely payment.
2.6 Insurance. The Grantor will continually insure the Premises against such perils or hazards as the Beneficiary may require, in
amounts, with acceptable co-insurance provisions, not less than the unpaid balance of the Obligations or the full replacement value
of the Improvements, whichever is less. The policies will contain an agreement by each insurer that the policy will not be terminated
or modified without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Beneficiary and will contain a mortgage clause acceptable to the
Beneficiary; and the Grantor will take such other action as the Beneficiary may reasonably request to ensure that the Beneficiary will
receive (subject to no other interests) the insurance proceeds from the Improvements. The Grantor hereby assigns all insurance
proceeds to and irrevocably directs, while any Obligations remain unpaid, any insurer to pay to the Beneficiary the proceeds of all
such insurance and any premium refund; and authorizes the Beneficiary to endorse the Grantor’s name to effect the same, to make,
adjust or settle, in the Grantor’s name, any claim on any insurance policy relating to the Premises. The proceeds and refunds will be
applied in such manner as the Beneficiary, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines to rebuilding of the Premises or to payment
ofthe Obligations, whether or not then due and payable.
2.7 Condemnation. Any compensation received for the taking of the Premises, or any part thereof, by a condemnation
proceeding (including payments in compromise of condemnation proceedings), and all compensation received as damages for
injury to the Premises, or any part thereof, shall be applied in such manner as the Beneficiary, in its sole and absolute discretion,
determines to rebuilding ofthe Premises or to payment ofthe Obligations, whether or not then due and payable.
2.8 Environmental Matters. Except as specifically disclosed by Grantor to Beneficiary in writing prior to the execution of this
Deed of Trust, Grantor represents and warrants as follows. There exists no uncorrected violation by the Grantor of any federal, state
or local laws (including statutes, regulations, ordinances or other governmental restrictions and requirements) relating to the
discharge of air pollutants, water pollutants or process waste water or otherwise relating to the environment or Hazardous
Substances as hereinafter defined, whether such laws currently exist or are enacted in the future (collectively "Environmental Laws").
The term "Hazardous Substances" will mean any hazardous or toxic wastes, chemicals or other substances, the generation,
possession or existence of which is prohibited or governed by any Environmental Laws. The Grantor is not subject to any judgment,
decree, order or citation, or a party to (or threatened with) any litigation or administrative proceeding, which asserts that the Grantor
(a) has violated any Environmental Laws; (b) is required to clean up, remove or take remedial or other action with respect to any
Hazardous Substances (collectively "Remedial Action"); or (c) is required to pay all or a portion ofthe cost of any Remedial Action,
as a potentially responsible party. Except as disclosed on the Borrower’s environmental questionnaire provided to the Beneficiary,
there are not now, nor to the Grantor’s knowledge after reasonable investigation have there ever been, any Hazardous Substances
(or tanks or other facilities for the storage of Hazardous Substances) stored, deposited, recycled or disposed of on, under or at any
real estate owned or occupied by the Grantor during the periods that the Grantor owned or occupied such real estate, which if
present on the real estate or in soils or ground water, could require Remedial Action. To the Grantor’s knowledge, there are no
proposed or pending changes in Environmental Laws which would adversely affect the Grantor or its business, and there are no
conditions existing currently or likely to exist while the Loan Documents are in effect which would subject the Grantor to Remedial
Action or other liability. The Grantor currently complies with and will continue to timely comply with all applicable Environmental
Laws; and will provide the Beneficiary, immediately upon receipt, copies of any correspondence, notice, complaint, order or other
document from any source asserting or alleging any circumstance or condition which requires or may require a financial contribution
by the Grantor or Remedial Action or other response by or on the part of the Grantor under Environmental Laws, or which seeks
damages or civil, criminal or punitive penalties from the Grantor for an alleged violation of Environmental Laws. In the event of any
such circumstance or condition, the Grantor agrees, at its expense and at the request of the Beneficiary, to permit an environmental
audit solely for the benefit of the Beneficiary, to be conducted by the Beneficiary or an independent agent selected by the Beneficiary
and which may not be relied on by the Grantor for any purpose. This provision shall not relieve the Grantor from conducting its own
environmental audits or taking any other steps necessary to comply with Environmental Laws.
2.9 Assignments. The Grantor will not assign, in whole or in part, without the Beneficiary's prior written consent, the rents,
issues or profits arising from the Premises.
2.10 Right of Inspection. The Beneficiary may at all reasonable times enter and inspect the Premises.
2.11 Waivers by Grantor. To the greatest extent that such rights may then be lawfully waived, the Grantor hereby agrees for
itself and any persons claiming under the Deed of Trust that it will waive and will not, at any time, insist upon or plead or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take any benefit or advantage of (a) any exemption, stay, extension or moratorium law now or at any
time hereafter in force; (b) any law now or hereafter in force providing for the valuation or appraisement of the Premises or any part
thereof prior to any sale or sales thereof to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained or pursuant to the decree, judgment
1714OR Page 3 of 8

or order of any court of competent jurisdiction; (c) to the extent permitted by law, any law now or at any time hereafter made or
enacted granting a right to redeem from foreclosure or any other rights of redemption in connection with foreclosure of, or exercise
of any power of sale under, this Deed of Trust; (d) any statute of limitations now or at any time hereafter in force; or (e) any right to
require marshalling of assets by the Beneficiary.
2.12 Assignment of Rents and Leases. The Grantor assigns and transfers to the Beneficiary, as additional security for the
Obligations, all right, title and interest ofthe Grantor in and to all leases which now exist or hereafter may be executed by or on behalf
ofthe Grantor covering the Premises and any extensions or renewals thereof, together with all Rents, it being intended that this is an
absolute and present assignment ofthe Rents. Notwithstanding that this assignment constitutes a present assignment of leases and
rents, the Grantor may collect the Rents and manage the Premises, but only if and so long as a default has not occurred. If a default
occurs, the right of Grantor to collect the Rents and to manage the Premises shall thereupon automatically terminate and such right,
together with other rights, powers and authorizations contained herein, shall belong exclusively to the Beneficiary. This assignment
confers upon the Beneficiary a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked by the Grantor. Upon the occurrence of a
default, the Beneficiary, at its option without notice and without seeking or obtaining the appointment of a receiver or taking actual
possession of the Premises may (a) give notice to any tenant(s) that the tenant(s) should begin making payments under their lease
agreement(s) directly to the Beneficiary or its designee; (b) commence a foreclosure action and file a motion for appointment of a
receiver; or (c) give notice to the Grantor that the Grantor should collect all Rents arising from the Premises and remit them to the
Beneficiary upon collection and that the Grantor should enforce the terms of the Iease(s) to ensure prompt payment by tenant(s)
under the Iease(s). All Rents received by the Grantor shall be held in trust by the Grantor for the Beneficiary. All such payments
received by the Beneficiary may be applied in any manner as the Beneficiary determines to payments required under this Deed of
Trust, the Loan Documents and the Obligations. The Grantor agrees to hold each tenant harmless from actions relating to tenant’s
payment of Rents to the Beneficiary.
2.13 Fixture Filing. From the date of its recording, this Deed of Trust shall be effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture
filing under the Uniform Commercial Code with respect to the Improvements and for this purpose the name and address of the
debtor is the name and address ofthe Grantor as set forth in this Deed of Trust and the name and address ofthe secured party is the
name and address of the Beneficiary as set forth in this Deed of Trust. The Mongaged Property includes goods which are or may
become so affixed to real property as to become fixtures. lf any ofthe Mortgaged Property is of a nature such that a security interest
therein can be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code, this Deed of Trust shall also constitute the grant of a security interest
to the Beneficiary and serve as a Security Agreement, and Grantor authorizes the filing of any financing statements and agrees to
execute other instruments that may be required for the further specification, perfection or renewal of such security interest.
ARTICLE III. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE BENEFICIARY
ln addition to all other rights (including setoff) and duties of the Beneficiary under the Loan Documents which are expressly
incorporated herein as a part of this Deed of Trust, the following provisions will also apply:
3.1 Beneficiary Authorized to Perform for Grantor. If the Grantor fails to perform any ofthe Grantor`s duties or covenants set
forth in this Deed of Trust, the Beneficiary may perform the duties or cause them to be performed, including, without limitation,
signing the Grantor’s name or paying any amount so required, and the cost, with interest at the default rate set forth in the Loan
Documents, will immediately be due from the Grantor to the Beneficiary from the date of expenditure by the Beneficiary to date of
payment by the Grantor, and will be one of the Obligations secured by this Deed of Trust. All acts by the Beneficiary are hereby
ratified and approved, and the Beneficiary will not be liable for any acts of commission or omission, nor for any errors of judgment or
mistakes of fact or law.
ARTICLE IV. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES
The Beneficiary may enforce its rights and remedies under this Deed of Trust upon default. A default will occur if the Grantor fails to
comply with the terms of any Loan Documents (including this Deed of Trust or any guaranty by the Grantor) or a demand for
payment is made under a demand loan, or the Grantor defaults on any other mortgage affecting the Land, or if any other obligor fails
to comply with the terms of any Loan Documents for which the Grantor has given the Beneficiary a guaranty or pledge. Upon the
occurrence of a default, the Beneficiary may declare the Obligations to be immediately due and payable.
4.1 Remedies. ln addition to the remedies for default set forth below and in the other Loan Documents, including acceleration,
the Beneficiary upon default will have all other rights and remedies for default available by law or equity. Upon a default, Beneficiary
may exercise the following remedies:
(a) Enforcement of Assignment of Rents and Leases. Beneficiary may:
(i) terminate the license granted to Grantor to collect the Rents (regardless of whether Beneficiary or Trustee shall have
entered into possession of the Mortgaged Property), collect and sue for the Rents in Beneficiary’s own name, give receipts and
releases therefor, and after deducting all expenses of collection, including reasonable attorneys` fees, apply the net proceeds
thereof to any Obligations as Beneficiary may elect;
(ii) make, modify, enforce, cancel or accept surrender of any leases, evict tenants, adjust Rents, maintain, decorate, refurbish,
repair, clean, and make space ready for renting, and otherwise do anything Beneficiary reasonably deems advisable in connec-
1714OR Page 4 of 8

tion with the Mortgaged Property;
(iii) apply the Rents so collected to the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property, including the payment of
reasonable management, brokerage and attorneys’ fees, or to the Obligations; and
(iv) require Grantor to transfer and deliver possession of all security deposits and records thereof to Beneficiary.
(b) Power of Sale. Beneficiary may require the Trustee, and the Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered, to enter and take
possession of the Premises and to sell all or part ofthe Mortgaged Property, at public auction, to the highest bidder for cash, free
from equity of redemption, and any statutory or common law right of redemption, homestead, dower, marital share, and all other
exemptions, after giving notice ofthe time, place and terms of such sale and ofthe Mortgaged Property to be sold, by advertising
the sale of the property as required by the statutes of Oregon. The Trustee may sell all or any portion ofthe Mortgaged Property
, together or in lots or parcels, and may execute and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers of such property a conveyance in fee
simple. The Trustee shall receive the proceeds thereof and shall apply the same as follows: (a) first, the payment of the
expenses of making, maintaining and executing this trust, protection of the Mortgaged Property, including the expense of any
litigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees of Trustee and Beneficiary, other costs specified herein, and reasonable compensation
to the Trustee; (b) second, to any advancements made by the Trustee or the Beneficiary pursuant hereto, with interest thereon;
(c) third, to the payment of the Obligations herein secured or intended so to be, in such order as Beneficiary shall elect, and any
balance of said Obligations may be the subject of immediate suit; (d) and, fourth, should there by any surplus, Trustee will pay it
to the Grantor, or to such person as may be legally entitled thereto. The sale or sales by Trustee of less than the whole of the
Mortgaged Property shall not exhaust the power of sale herein granted, and the Trustee is specifically empowered to make
successive sale or sales under such power until the whole of the Mortgaged Property shall be sold; and if the proceeds of such
sale or sales of less than the whole ofthe Premises shall be less than the aggregate ofthe Obligations and the expenses thereof,
this Deed of Trust and the lien, security interest and assignment hereof shall remain in full force and effect as to the unsold portion
of the Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that Grantor shall never have any right to require the sale or sales of less than the
whole of the Mortgaged Property, but Beneficiary shall have the right at its sole election, to request the Trustee to sell less than
the whole of the Mortgaged Property. Beneficiary may bid and become the purchaser of all or any part of the Mortgaged
Property at any such sale, and the amount of Beneficiary's successful bid may be credited on the Obligations.
(c) Judicial and Other Relief. Beneficiary or Trustee may proceed by a suit or suits in equity or at law, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein granted, or for any
foreclosure hereunder or for the sale of the Mortgaged Property under the judgment or decree of any court or courts of
competent jurisdiction. In the event that this Deed of Trust shall be foreclosed by judicial process, then to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Beneficiary shall be entitled to a deficiencyjudgment if the proceeds of such foreclosure shall be insufficient
to pay all of the Obligations and allowed costs and expenses.
(d) Entry on Premises.
(i) Beneficiary may enter into and upon and take possession of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, and may exclude
Grantor, and all persons claiming under Grantor, and its agents or servants, wholly or partly therefrom; and, holding the same,
Beneficiary may use, administer, manage, operate, and control the Mortgaged Property and may exercise all rights and powers of
Grantor in the name, place and stead of Grantor, or othenivise, as the Beneficiary shall deem best; and in the exercise of any of
the foregoing rights and powers Beneficiary shall not be liable to Grantor for any loss or damage thereby sustained unless due
solely to the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Beneficiary.
(e) Receiver. Beneficiary may make application to a court of competent jurisdiction, as a matter of strict right and without notice
to Grantor or regard to the adequacy of the Mortgaged Property for the repayment of the Obligations, for appointment of a
receiver of the Mortgaged Property, and Grantor does hereby irrevocably consent to such appointment. Any such receiver shall
have all necessary and proper powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including the full power to rent, maintain and
otherwise operate the Mortgaged Property upon such terms as may be approved by the court.
(f) Remedies Cumulative, Concurrent and Nonexclusive. If the Obligations are now or hereafter further secured by chattel
mortgages, other deeds of trust, security agreements, pledges, contracts of guaranty, assignments of leases, or other security,
Beneficiary may, at its option, exhaust its remedies under any one or more of said instruments and this Deed of Trust, either
concurrently or independently, and in such order as Beneficiary may determine. Beneficiary shall have all rights, remedies and
recourses granted in the Loan Documents and available to it at law or equity (including, without limitation, those granted by the
Uniform Commercial Code), and same (a) shall be cumulative, concurrent, and nonexclusive, (b) may be pursued separately,
successively or concurrently against Grantor or others obligated for the Obligations, or any part thereof or against any one or
more of them, or against the Mortgaged Property, at the sole discretion of Beneficiary, and (c) may be exercised as often as
occasion therefor shall arise, it being agreed by Grantor that the exercise of or failure to exercise any of same shall in no event be
construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy or recourse.
(g) Waiver by the Beneficiary. The Beneficiary may permit the Grantor to attempt to remedy any default without waiving its
rights and remedies hereunder, and the Beneficiary may waive any default without waiving any other subsequent or prior default
by the Grantor. Furthermore, delay on the part of the Beneficiary in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or at law
1714OR Page 5 of 8

will not operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of such right, power or privilege preclude other exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver or suspension will be deemed to have occurred unless
the Beneficiary has expressly agreed in writing specifying such waiver or suspension.
(h) Attorneys’ Fees and Other Costs. Attorneys’ fees, whether incurred before or after commencement of litigation or at trial,
on appeal or in any other proceeding; costs of procuring title insurance commitments and title searches; appraisals; environ-
mental testings, reports and audits; and other costs incurred in connection with this Deed of Trust may be recovered by the
Beneficiary and included in any sale made hereunder or by judgment of foreclosure.
ARTICLE V. TRUSTEE
5.1 Action by Trustee. The Trustee named herein shall be clothed with full power to act when action hereunder shall be
required, and to execute any conveyance of the Mortgaged Property. In the event that the substitution of the Trustee shall become
necessary for any reason, the substitution of a trustee in the place of that named herein shall be sufficient. The term "Trustee" shall
be construed to mean "Trustees" whenever the sense requires. The necessity of the Trustee herein named, or any successor in trust,
making oath or giving bond, is expressly waived.
5.2 Employment of Agents. The Trustee, or any one acting in it’s stead, shall have, in it’s discretion, authority to employ all
property agents and attorneys in the execution of this trust and/or in the conducting of any sale made pursuant to the terms hereof,
and to pay for such services rendered out of the proceeds of the sale of the Mortgaged Property, should any be realized; and if no
sale be made or if the proceeds of sale be insufficient to pay the same, then Grantor hereby undertakes and agrees to pay the cost of
such services rendered to said Trustee. Trustee may rely on any document believed by it in good faith to be genuine. All money
received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust, but need not be segregated (except to the
extent required by law), and the Trustee shall not be liable for interest thereon.
5.3 Indemnification of Trustee. lf the Trustee shall be made a party to or shall intervene in any action or proceeding affecting
the Mortgaged Property or the title thereto, or the interest of the Trustee or Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust, the Trustee and
Beneficiary shall be reimbursed by Grantor, immediately and without demand, for all reasonable costs, charges and attorneys’ fees
incurred by them or either of them in any such case, and the same shall be secured hereby as a further charge and lien upon the
Mortgaged Property.
5.4 Trustee and Successor Trustee. Beneficiary may at any time, including any time before, during or after the
commencement or completion of any foreclosure proceeding, remove Trustee (with or without cause) and appoint a successor
Trustee by an instrument executed, acknowledged and recorded in the real estate records, which recording may take place before,
during or after the commencement or completion of any foreclosure proceeding, and any such successor Trustee shall thereupon
succeed to Trustee as Trustee hereunder as if named herein. No defect in the removal of Trustee or in the appointment of a
successor or in the execution and recording of such appointment shall affect the validity thereof. Additionally, whether the recording
of the successor Trustee instrument takes place before, during or after the commencement or completion of any foreclosure
proceeding shall have no effect upon the validity of said proceeding. Trustee shall not be disqualified by reason that Trustee is an
officer, employee or stockholder of Beneficiary, or has an interest in the Obligations. All parties waive any objection to Trustee having
any such interest. Trustee shall be liable only for gross negligence or willful misconduct. No indemnity or remedy herein conferred is
exclusive of any other remedy or indemnity, but each shall be in addition to every other hereunder and at law or in equity. No delay
or omission by Trustee or Beneficiary to exercise any right or power shall impair such right or power or be construed as a waiver of
any default or an acquiescence therein. lf Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right by foreclosure, entry or otherwise, and
such proceedings are discontinued for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely, then Grantor and Trustee shall severally
and respectively be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder.
ARTICLE VI. MISCELLANEOUS
