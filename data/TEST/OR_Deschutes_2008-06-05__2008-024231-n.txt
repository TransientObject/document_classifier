the right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencurnbered, except for encumbrances of
record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands,
subject to any encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform
covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real
property.
UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
l. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges.
Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any
prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items
pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S.
currency. However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this
Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments
due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as selected
by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s check or cashier’s check,
provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at
such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15.
Lender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to
bring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan
current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial
payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are
accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest
on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan
current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds
or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal
balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now
or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this
Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all
payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due
under the Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be
applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be
applied first to late charges, second to any other amormts due under this Security Instrument, and then to
reduce the principal balance of the Note.
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a
sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the
late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from
Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in
full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more
Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be
applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under
the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due
under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for:
(a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or
encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums
for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any,
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT

. I

0s05EM000sa6
or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any
time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and
Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item.
Borrower shall promptly fumish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower
shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower’s obligation to pay the Funds
for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower’s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all
Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower
shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of
Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such
payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower’s obligation to make such payments and
to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security
Instrrunent, as the phrase "covenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay
Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item,
Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated
under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow
Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section l5 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall
pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to
apply the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can
require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and
reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable
Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in
any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time
specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually
analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the
Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing or
Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any
interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be
paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as
required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to
Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as
defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to
Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than l2
monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall
notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up
the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than l2 monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund
to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions
attributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or
ground rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the
extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to
Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or
defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender’s opinion operate to prevent
the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are
concluded; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT

L I

lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which
can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien.
Within l0 days of the date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more
of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.
Lender may require Borrower to pay a one—time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or
reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan.
5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on
the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other
hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This
insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender
requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan.
The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender’s right to
disapprove Borrower’s choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower
to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification
and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and
subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such
determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination
resulting from an objection by Borrower.
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance
coverage, at Lender’s option and Borrower’s expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any
particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not
protect Borrower, Borrower’s equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard
or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower
acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of
insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall
become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at
the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender
to Borrower requesting payment.
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender’s
right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as
mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal
certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and
renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for
damage to, or destruction of] the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall
name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender
may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in
writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be
applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and
Lender’s security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to
hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work
has been completed to Lender’s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly.
Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress
payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires
interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or
earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be
paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is
not economically feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to
the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to
Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
  346.34 Page 5 of 14 Form 3038 I/0l
I

ososzmooosss
claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the
insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day
period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section
22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower’s rights to any insurance proceeds in an
amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of
Borrower’s rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all
insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property.
Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid
under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower’s principal
residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the
Property as Borrower’s principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender
otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating
circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower’s control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not
destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property.
Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent
the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to
Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property
if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in
connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or
restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds
for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is
completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property,
Borrower is not relieved of Borrower’s obligation for the completion of such repair or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has
reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give
Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
8. Borrower’s Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application
process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower’s
knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or
failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations
include, but are not limited to, representations conceming Borrower’s occupancy of the Property as
Borrower’s principal residence.
9. Protection of Lender’s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument.
If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there
is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender’s interest in the Property and/or rights under this
Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for
enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or
regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is
reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this Security
Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the
Property. Lender’s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which
has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to
protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position
in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to
make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate
building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities tumed on or off`. Although
Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or
obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized
under this Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
  346.34 Page 6 of 14 Form 3038 1/01
1

0805EM000586
secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of
disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting
payment.
If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the
lease. Borrower shall not surrender the leasehold estate and interests herein conveyed or terminate or cancel
the ground lease. Borrower shall not, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the
ground lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge
unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the
Loan, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any
reason, the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer
that previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments
toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage
substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to
the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer
selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall
continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the
insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-
refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable,
notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay
Borrower any interest or eamings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if
Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer
selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments
toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of
making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums
for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect,
or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender’s requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in
accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until
termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section l0 affects Borrower’s obligation to pay
interest at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it
may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may
enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements
are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to
these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of
funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage
Insurance premiums).
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer,
any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that
derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower’s payments for Mortgage Insurance, in
exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer’s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides
that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer’s risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to
the insurer, the arrangement is often termed "captive reinsurance." Further:
(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for
Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount
Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the
Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may
include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage
Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any
Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.

ll. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.
If the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of
the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender’s security is not lessened. During
such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until
Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender’s
satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and
restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an
agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds,
Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the
restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous
Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the
excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in
Section 2.
In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous
Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the
excess, if any, paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market
value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater
than the amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking,
destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this
Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the
following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking,
destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the
partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market
value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the
amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless
Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.
If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the
Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages,
Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to
collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that
owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to
Miscellaneous Proceeds.
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in
Lender’s judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender’s interest
in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration
has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a
ruling that, in Lender’s judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of
Lender’s interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim
for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender’s interest in the Property are hereby assigned
and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be
applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender
to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or
any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
  346.34 Page 8 of l4 Form 3038 l/0l
L- . r

0805EM000586
Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization
of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or
any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy
including, without limitation, Lender’s acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in
Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the
exercise of any right or remedy.
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants
and agrees that Borrower’s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who
co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-signer"): (a) is co—signing this Security
Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co—signer’s interest in the Property under the terms of this
Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and
(c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any
accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the co—signer’s
consent.
Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes
Borrower’s obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all
of Borrower’s rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from
Borrower’s obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in
writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section
20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services perfonned in connection with
Borrower’s default, for the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this
Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In
regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specihc fee
to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees
that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted
so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the
permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the
charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted
limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed
under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will
be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is
provided for under the Note). Borrower’s acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower
will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument
must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to
have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower’s notice
address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless
Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless
Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify
Lender of Borrower’s change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower’s change of
address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be
only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall
be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender’s address stated herein unless Lender
has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument
shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by
this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy
the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be
governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and
obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
  346.34 Page 9 of 14 Form 3038 1/01
1

0805EM000586
Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it
might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the
event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such
conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect
without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include
corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and
include the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take
any action.
17. Borr0wer’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security
Instrument.
18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,
"lnterest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to,
those benencial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or
escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower
is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender’s prior
written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by
Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall
provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15
within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these
sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security
Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.
19. Borrower’s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions,
Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior
to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in this
Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower’s
right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that
Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as
if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all
expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’
fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender’s
interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may
reasonably require to assure that Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument,
and Borrower’s obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged.
Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following
forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s check or
cashier’s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal
agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this
Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had
occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in
the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to
Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects Periodic
Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing
obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more
changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer,
Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan
Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in
connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a
OREGON -Single Family — Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
  346.34 Page 10 of 14 Form 3038 1/01
I

0805EM000sa6
Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will
remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the
Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an
individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party’s actions pursuant to this Security
Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of,
this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in
compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a
reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time
period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable
for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant
to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to
satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.
21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 2l: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those
substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the
following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and
herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b)
"Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate
to health, safety or environmental protection; (c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action,
remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) an "Environmental Condition"
means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.
Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous
Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do,
nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law,
(b) which creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a
Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two
sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous
Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of
the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit
or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any
Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of
release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a
Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by
any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any
Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial
actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an
Environmental Cleanup.
NON-UNIF ORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration
following Borrower’s breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior
to acceleration under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify:
(a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the
date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure
the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured
by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property. The notice shall further inform Borrower of the
right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a
default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale. lf the default is not cured on or
before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of
all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of
sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all
OREGON -Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
  346.34 Page ll of 14 Form 3038 l/01
I

0a05EM00o5B6
expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of title evidence.
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written
notice of the occurrence of an event of default and of Lender’s election to cause the Property to be sold
and shall cause such notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is located.
Lender or Trustee shall give notice of sale in the manner prescribed by Applicable Law to Borrower
and to other persons prescribed by Applicable Law. After the time required by Applicable Law,
Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at
the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in
any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of all or any parcel of the Property by public
announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled sale. Lender or its designee may
purchase the Property at any sale.
Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee’s deed conveying the Property without any
covenant or warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee’s deed shall be prima facie
evidence of the truth of the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the
following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee’s and
attorneys’ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or
persons legally entitled to it.
23. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall
request Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing
debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty to
the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or persons shall pay any recordation costs. Lender
may charge such person or persons a fee for reconveying the Property, but only if the fee is paid to a third
party (such as the Trustee) for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable
Law.
24. Substitute Trustee. Lender may from time to time remove Trustee and appoint a successor
trustee to any Trustee appointed hereunder. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee shall
succeed to all the title, power and duties conferred upon Trustee herein and by Applicable Law.
25. Attorneys’ Fees. As used in this Security Instrument and in the Note, attorneys’ fees shall
include those awarded by an appellate court.
26. Protective Advances. This Security Instrument secures any advances Lender, at its discretion,
may make under Section 9 of this Security Instrument to protect Lender’s interest in the Property and rights
under this Security Instrument.
27. Required Evidence of Property Insurance.
WARNING
Unless you provide us with evidence of the insurance coverage as required by our
contract or loan agreement, we may purchase insurance at your expense to protect our
interest. This insurance may, but need not, also protect your interest. If the collateral
becomes damaged, the coverage we purchase may not pay any claim you make or any
claim made against you. You may later cancel this coverage by providing evidence that you
have obtained property coverage elsewhere.
You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost of this
insurance may be added to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your
contract or loan balance, the interest rate on the underlying contract or loan will apply to
this added amount. The effective date of coverage may be the date your prior coverage
lapsed or the date you failed to provide proof of coverage.
The coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance
you can obtain on your own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or
any mandatory liability insurance requirements imposed by Applicable Law.

BALLOON RIDER
(CONDITIONAL RIGHT TO REFINANCE)
THIS BALLOON RIDER is made this 3 day of Jge , 2008 , and is incorporated into
and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the "Security
Instrument") of the same date given by the undersigned ("Borrower") to secure Borrower’s Note to Snug; Valley
Bank & Trust ("Lender") of the same date and covering the property described in the Security Instrument and
located at:
l0l5O Sundance Ridge Loo_t;,Redmgng OR 97756
[Property Address]
The interest rate stated on the Note is called the "Note Rate." The date of the Note is called the "Note
Date." I understand Lender may transfer the Note, Security Instrument, and this Rider. Lender or anyone who
takes the Note, the Security Instrument, and this Rider by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under the
Note is called the "Note Holder."
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. In addition to the covenants and agreements in the Security Instrument,
Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows (despite anything to the contrary contained in the
Security Instrument or the Note):
1. CONDITIONAL RIGHT TO REFINANCE
At the Maturity Date ofthe Note and Security Instrument (the "Maturity Date"), I will be able to obtain a
new loan ("New Loan") with a new Maturity Date of June l, 2014 , and with an interest rate equal to the "New
Note Rate” determined in accordance with Section 3 below if all the conditions provided in Section 2 and 5 below
are met (the "Conditional Refinancing Option"). If those conditions are not met, I understand that the Note Holder
is under no obligation to refinance or modify the Note, or to extend the Maturity Date, and that I will have to repay
the Note from my own resources or fmd a lender willing to lend me the money to repay the Note.
2. CONDITIONS TO OPTION
If I want to exercise the Conditional Refinancing Option at maturity, certain conditions must be met as of
the Maturity Date. These conditions are: (a) I must still be the owner of the property subject to the Security
Instrument (the “Property"); (b) I must be current in my monthly payments and cannot have been more than 30 days
late on any of the l2 scheduled monthly payments immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (c) the New Note Rate
cannot be more than five percentage points above the Note Rate; and (d) I must make a written request to the Note
Holder as provided in Section 5 below.
3. CALCULATING THE NEW NOTE RATE
The New Note Rate will be a fixed rate of interest equal to Fannie Mae’s required net yield for 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages subject to a 60-day mandatory delivery commitment, plus one-half of one percentage point
(0.5%), rounded to the nearest one—eighth of one percentage point (0.125%) (the "New Note Rate”). The required
net yield shall be the applicable net yield in effect on the date and time of day that the Note Holder receives notice of
my election to exercise the Conditional Refmancing Option. If this required net yield is not available, the Note
Holder will determine the New Note Rate by using comparable information.
4. CALCULATING THE NEW PAYMENT AMOUNT
Provided the New Note Rate as calculated in Section 3 above is not greater than tive percentage points
above the Note Rate and all other conditions required in Section 2 above are satisfied, the Note Holder will
determine the amount of the monthly payment that will be sufficient to repay in full (a) the unpaid principal, plus (b)
accrued but unpaid interest, plus (c) all other sums I will owe under the Note and Security Instrument on the
Maturity Date (assuming my monthly payments then are current, as required under Section 2 above), over the term
MULTISTATE BALLOON RIDER-—Single Family—Fnnnie Mae Uniform Instrument Form 3180 I/01 (rev. 9/01) (page I 0f2)

of the New Note at the New Note Rate in equal monthly payments. The result of this calculation will be the amount
of my new principal and interest payment every month until the New Note is fully paid.
5. EXERCISING THE CONDITIONAL REF INANCING OPTION
The Note Holder will notify me at least 60 calendar clays in advance ofthe Maturity Date and advise me of
the principal, accrued but unpaid interest, and all other sums I am expected to owe on the Maturity Date. The Note
Holder also will advise me that I may exercise the Conditional Refinancing Option if the conditions in Section 2
above are met. The Note Holder will provide my payment record information, together with the name, title, and
address of the person representing the Note Holder that I must notify in order to exercise the Conditional
Refinancing Option. If I meet the conditions of Section 2 above, I may exercise the Conditional Refinancing Option
by notifying the Note Holder no later than 45 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date. The Note Holder will
calculate the fixed New Note Rate based upon Fannie Mae’s applicable published required net yield in effect on the
date and time of day notification is received by the Note Holder and as calculated in Section 3 above. I will then
have 30 calendar days to provide the Note Holder with acceptable proof of my required ownership. Before the
Maturity Date, the Note Holder will advise me ofthe new interest rate (the New Note Rate), new monthly payment
amount, and a date, time, and place at which I must appear to sign any documents required to complete the required
refinancing. I understand the Note Holder will charge me a $250 processing fee and the costs associated with
updating the title insurance policy, if any.
BY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this Balloon
Rider.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT RIDER
cox
Loan #2 0805EM000586
THIS PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT RIDER is made this 3RD day of JUNE, 2008, and is
incorporated into and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the Mortgage, Deed of Trust or Security Deed (the
"Security Instrument") of the same date, given by the undersigned (the "Borrower") to secure Borrower's Note to
SOUTH VALLEY BANK s. TRUST, (the "Lender") ofthe same date and covering the Property described in the
Security Instrument and located at:
10150 SUNDANCE RIDGE LOOP, REDMOND, OR 97756
[Property Address]
The Property includes, but is not limited to, a parcel of land improved with a dwelling, together with other such
parcels and certain common areas and facilities, as described in THE COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND
RESTRICTIONS FILED OF RECORD THAT AFFECT THE PROPERTY (the "Declaration"). The Property is a
part of a planned unit development known as
RIDGE AT EAGLE CREST OWNERS ' ASSOCATION
[Name of Planned Unit Development]
(the "PUD"). The Property also includes Borrower's interest in the homeowners association or equivalent entity
owning or managing the common areas and facilities of the PUD (the "Owners Association") and the uses, benefits
and proceeds of Borrower's interest.
PUD COVENANTS. In addition to the covenants and agreements made in the Security Instrument,
Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
A. PUD Obligations. Borrower shall perform all of Borrower's obligations under the
PUD's Constituent Documents. The "Constituents Documents" are the: (i) Declaration; (ii) articles
of incorporation, trust instrument or any equivalent document which creates the Owners
Association; and (iii) any by-laws or other rules or regulations of the Owners Association.
Borrower shall promptly pay, when due, all dues and assessments imposed pursuant to the
Constituent Documents.
B. Property Insurance. So long as the Owners Association maintains, with a generally
accepted insurance carrier, a "master" or "blanket" policy insuring the Property which is
satisfactory to Lender and which provides insurance coverage in the amounts (including
deductible levels), for the periods, and against loss by fire, hazards included within the term
MULTISTATE PUD RIDER- Single Family -Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT

LL TLLTSLTTL I

0B05EM00o586
"extended coverage," and any other hazards, including, but not limited to, earthquakes and
floods, for which Lender requires insurance, then: (i) Lender waives the provision in
Section 3 for the Periodic Payment to Lender of the yearly premium installments for
property insurance on the Property; and (ii) Borrower’s obligation under Section 5 to
maintain property insurance coverage on the Property is deemed satisfied to the extent that
the required coverage is provided by the Owners Association policy.
What Lender requires as a condition of this waiver can change during the term of
the loan.
Borrower shall give Lender prompt notice of any lapse in required property
insurance coverage provided by the master or blanket policy.
In the event of a distribution of hazard insurance proceeds in lieu of restoration or
repair following a loss to the Property, or to common areas and facilities of the PUD, any
proceeds payable to Borrower are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Lender
shall apply the proceeds to the sums secured by the Security Instrument, whether or not
then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.
C. Public Liability Insurance. Borrower shall take such actions as may be
reasonable to insure that the Owners Association maintains a public liability insurance
policy acceptable in form, amount, and extent of coverage to Lender.
D. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or
consequential, payable to Borrower in connection with any condemnation or other taking
of all or any part of the Property or the common areas and facilities of the PUD, or for any
conveyance in lieu of condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Such
proceeds shall be applied by Lender to the sums secured by the Security Instrument as
provided in Section 11.
E. Lender's Prior Consent. Borrower shall not, except after notice to Lender and
with Lender's prior written consent, either partition or subdivide the Property or consent to:
(i) the abandonment or termination of the PUD, except for abandonment or termination
required by law in the case of substantial destruction by tire or other casualty or in the case
of a taking by condemnation or eminent domain; (ii) any amendment to any provision of
the "Constituent Documents" if the provision is for the express benefit of Lender; (iii)
termination of professional management and assumption of self-management of the
Owners Association; or (iv) any action which would have the effect of rendering the public
liability insurance coverage maintained by the Owners Association unacceptable to Lender.
F. Remedies. If Borrower does not pay PUD dues and assessments when due,
then Lender may pay them. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph F shall
become additional debt of Borrower secured by the Security Instrument. Unless Borrower
and Lender agree to other terms of payment, these amounts shall bear interest from the date
of disbursement at the Note rate and shall be payable, with interest, upon notice from
Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
