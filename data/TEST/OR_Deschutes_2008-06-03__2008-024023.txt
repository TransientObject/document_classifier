sums, with interest thereon, advanced in accordance herewith to protect the security of this Deed of Trust; and

Borrower covenants that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to grant
and convey the Property, and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower
covenants that Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and
demands, subject to encumbrances of record.
UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
1. Payment of Principal and Interest. Borrower shall promptly pay when due the principal and interest
indebtedness evidenced by the Note and late charges as provided in the Note.

Trust, and ground rents on the Property, if any, plus one-twelfth of yearly premium installments for hazard
insurance, plus one-twelfth of yearly premium installments for mortgage insurance, if any, all as reasonably
estimated initially and from time to time by Lender on the basis of assessments and bills and reasonable estimates

makes such payments to the holder of a prior mortgage or deed of trust if such holder is an institutional lender.
If Borrower pays Funds to Lender, the Funds shall be held in an institution the deposits or accounts of which
are insured or guaranteed by a Federal or state agency (including Lender if Lender is such an institution). Lender
shall apply the Funds to pay said taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and ground rents. Lender may not
charge for so holding and applying the Funds, analyzing said account or verifying and compiling said assessments
and bills, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and applicable law permits Lender to make such a
charge. Borrower and Lender may agree in writing at the time of execution of this Deed of Trust that interest on
the Funds shall be paid to Borrower, and unless such agreement is made or applicable law requires such interest
to be paid, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Lender shall give
to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds showing credits and debits to the Funds and the
purpose for which each debit to the Funds was made. The Funds are pledged as additional security for the sums
secured by this Deed of Trust.
If the amount of the Funds held by Lender, together with the future monthly installments of Funds payable
prior to the due dates of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and ground rents, shall exceed the amount
required to pay said taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and ground rents as they fall due, such excess shall
be, at Borrower's option, either promptly repaid to Borrower or credited to Borrower on monthly installments of
Funds. If the amount of the Funds held by Lender shall not be sufficient to pay taxes, assessments, insurance

any Funds held by Lender. If under paragraph 17 hereof the Property is sold or the Property is otherwise

Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage", and such other
hazards as Lender may require and in such amounts and for such periods as Lender may require.

of any mortgage, deed of trust or other security agreement with a lien which has priority over this Deed of Trust.

make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

insurance terminates in accordance with Borrower's and Lender's written agreement or applicable law.

thereof. Nothing contained in this paragraph 7 shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action
hereunder.

by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower and Borrower's successors in interest. Any forbearance

Trustee under the terms of this Deed of Trust, (b) is not personally liable on the Note or under this Deed of Trust,

to enforce this Deed of Trust discontinued at any time prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the fifth day before sale

the Note had no acceleration occurred; (b) Borrower cures all breaches of any other covenants or agreements of
Borrower contained in this Deed of Trust; (c) Borrower pays all reasonable expenses incurred by Lender and
Trustee in enforcing the covenants and agreements of Borrower contained in this Deed of Trust, and in enforcing
