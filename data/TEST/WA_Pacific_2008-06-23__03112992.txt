UNIFORVI COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges.
Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any
prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items
pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S.
currency. However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this
Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments
due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as
selected by Lender; (a) cash tb) money order; te) certified check, bank check, treasurer's cheek or
cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a
federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at
such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15.
Lender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to
bring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan
current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial
payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are
accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay
interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring
the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply
such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding
principal balance under the l\ote immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower
might have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under
the Note and this Security Instrume;nt or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security g
Instrument. N 2 
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise d.eseribed in this Section 2, all m ,,_¤g
payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest GI ° 3 6
due under the Note; tb) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such paytnents N eg:
shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it becasune due. Any remaining amounts : ig E
shall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and m to E 3
then to reduce the principal balance of the Note. .;
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a   3
sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and   *2
the late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received  
from Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the- extent that, each payment cart be  
paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or   ,6
more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall • 
be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the Note. — 
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under  
the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments. E
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due Ei
under the Note, until the Note is paid in lull, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due E
for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a §—=
lien or encunihrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c)  
premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance :2 E
premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to bender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage E 8

Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, tees and
assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to
be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives
Borrower's obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower's
obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be
in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts
due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires,
shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require.
Borrower's obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts slrall for all purposes be deemed to
be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instniment, as the phrase "covenant and agreement"
is used in Seciion 9. lt` Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and
Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9
and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such
amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in
accordance with Section I5 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in
such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect amd hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply
the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can
require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and
reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable
Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in
any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time
specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually 0%
analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the N •·• gg
Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing m 'S : g
or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall 1.10t be required to pay Borrower gl I, g  
any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest ,,.., .. Q ¤
shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower. without charge, an annual accounting; of the an gg E
Funds as required by RESPA. U} { 3 E
lf there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to   6,

Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
Borrower: ta) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable
to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (l>) contests the lien in good faith
by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to
prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings
are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating
the lien to this Security Instrument. lf Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien
which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the
lien. Within IO days of the date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or
more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.

other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance.
This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that
Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of
the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender's
right to disapprove Borrowers choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may
require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) at one—time charge for flood zone
determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one—time charge for flood zone determination
and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which {L
reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the ,,3
payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the N "gc
review of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower. gi, Yi u  
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance N .;,53
coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any qq ·- R g
particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might F1 35E
not protect Borrower, Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, m rf 8 E
hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower   S
acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of |  $5
insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall in-.
become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest un"-'=
at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from  
Lender to Borrower requesting payment.   E
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender's :_

mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal ` 
certificates. lf Lender requires. Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and  
renewal notices. lf Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, · 
for damage to, or destruction oi`, the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and '“‘¤-it
shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.  
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender ll'.-.*' ,_
may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree   ig;
in writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall   E
be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and
Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to

work has been completed to l.en·:ler’s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken
promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series
of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law
requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any
interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by
Borrower shall not be paid ot.t of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. lf

proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security instrument, whether or not then due, with
the excess, if a.ny, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in
Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance
claim and related matters. lf Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the
insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate turd settle the claim. The 30-day
period will begin when the notice is given. ln either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under
Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance
proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and
(b) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by
Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the
coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or
to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.

residence within 60 days after thc execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the

shall be responsible for repairzng or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such  
purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of '§'-
progress payments as the work is completed. lf the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient   P

coverage substantially equivalent to thc Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially UI °3 6
equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in eflect, from an alternate N °S°
mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not "" {B2
available, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that °`° {S 3
were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these E? “·¤ if
payments as a nonrefundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be   Q
nonrefundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be ——=——-—-`—..1.,`“ :3
required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss —-"Z.—-‘!°··.._ ‘°
reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) *3
provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires ··-— 
separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage _"`“  ,_
Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated   D
payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to .;
maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until I..erider's — 
requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and . 
Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this —._"'_"'_':
Section IO affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the rate provided inthe Note. . 
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it ;_-E--1*
may incur if Borrower does tltlt repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage __ ·-·—
Insurance.  
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may ...·-2:-'.,_ ;;·
enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements   §
are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to ”*———— ¤
these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source
of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage
Insurance premiums).

As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note. another insurer, any reinsurer,
any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that
derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrowers payments for Mortgage Insurance, in
exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer`s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement
provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer's risk irt exchange for a share of the
premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed “captive reinsurance? Further:
(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for
Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount
Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has ·- if any - with respect to the
Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998- or any other law. These rights
may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the
Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a
refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or
termination.
ll. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfelture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.

During such repair and restoration period., Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds
until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to
Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the
repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is
completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such
Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such
Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would A
be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, m 2*,
whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be hl "' $3
applied in the order provided for in Section 2. U} *1; : g
In the event of a total takin, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous m mg  
Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with N __ if .,
the excess, if ary, paid to Borrower. : gg E
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market m {EE
value of the Property immediately bei`ore the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or
greater than the amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial E  
taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums   E
secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds  
multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the .-""¤=
partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property § 
immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower. -¤-E5 Z
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market  
value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the  
amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless  
Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums E
secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due. 5.;:;
lf the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the  
Opposing Patty (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages,  
Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized  
to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the ¤"" ;;
sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party i' means the third party $' §
that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in   ¤.
regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.

Lender`s judgment, couid result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's
interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if
acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by· causing the actton or proceeding to be
dismissed with a ruling that, in Lenders judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material
impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of
any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender's interest in the Property
are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be
applied in the order provided lor in Section 2.
I2. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender
to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower
or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against
any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify
amortization ofthe sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original
Borrower or any Successors ir1 Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or
remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or
Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or
preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
13. .Ioint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants
and agrees that Borrower`s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who
co—signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co—signer"): (a) is co-signing this
Security Instrirment only to mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer's interest in the Property under the
terms of this Security Instrument; (bl is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or
make any acconimodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the

Borrower's obligations under zhis Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain U, 'S gg
all of Borrower's rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from cj _` g -
Borrower`s obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in N ··• gg
writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in 1-I :;;.9.
Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender. FU UTE
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with TO {gi
Borrower's default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this   T
Security Instniment, including. but not limited to, attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees.    
In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific   '°
fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge  
fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.  
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so   ,.
that the interest: or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the   D
permitted limits, then: (al any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the g
charge to the permitted limit; and (b} any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded pemritted  
limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal  
owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. ll` zi refund reduces principal, the  
reduction will be treated as .1 partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a  
prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by Eé
direct payment to Borrower witl constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out Y;
of such overcharge. E
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument   E
must be in writxng. Any notice to Borrower in comiection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to E §

notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers
unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address
unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly
notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. lf Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's
change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure.
There may be only one designated. notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any
notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address
stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in
connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually
received by Lender. lf any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable
Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security
Instrument.
I6. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be
governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and
obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of
Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it
might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In
the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conllicts with Applicable
Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be
given effect without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include
corresponding neuter words or wo;rds of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and
include the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to
take any action. ‘
17. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18, ¤.

to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or N .,, Q (I
escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser. m ° u *'
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower U1 :'_,‘   g
is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior EE __ E 0
written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security N 32E
Instrument. However, this option shall not bc exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by In {E 2
Applicable Law. °
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall -5 S
provide a pericd of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15    
within which Borrower must pay all surns secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay  
these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this '§
Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.  
19. Bor·rower's Right to Reinstale After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions,   5
Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instmment discontinued at any time §
prior to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in ;
this Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of  
Borrower's right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those - 
conditions are that Borrower: (:1) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security ;
Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or g
agreements; (c) pays all expenses in-curred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited  
to. reasonable attomeys' fees. property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the ir;
purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) E
takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest. in the Property and   E
rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security ; 3
Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and °""`_ °`
expenses in one or more of the following fomts, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (bl money order; (c)

shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not
apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in
the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to
Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects
Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan
servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be
one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. lf there is a change of the Loan
Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the
new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA
requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. lf the Note is sold and thereafter the L.oan is
serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations
to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not
assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an
individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this
Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by
reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such
notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the
other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If
Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time
period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and
opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to g§
Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective N __ 53
action provisions of this Section 20. U} ¤ : g
