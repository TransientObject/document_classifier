judgment against Borrower if the Security Instrument is foreclosed.
ll. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required irnrnediate payment in full. This right applies
even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate this Security Instrument, Borrower shall correct the condition which -
resulted in the requirement for irnrnediate payment in full. Foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary attomeys' fees and

situations where the amount secured by the Security Instrument equals or exceeds the maximum principal amount stated or
the maximum period under which loan advances retain the same lien priority initially granted to loan advances has expired)
and state law permits the original lien status to be maintained for future loan advances through the execution and recordation
’ of one or more documents, then Lender shall obtain title evidence at Borrower's expense. If the title evidence indicates that
` the Property is not encurnbered by any liens (except the First Security lristrtunent described in Paragraph l3(a), this Second
Security Instrument and any subordinate liens that the Lender determines will also be subordinate to any future loan
advances), Lender shall request the Borrower to execute such documents. If state law does not permit the original lien status

prevent the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the Property; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an
agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to all amounts secured by this Security Instrtunent. If Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender

above within ten (l 0) days of the giving of notice. .

20. Foreclosure Procedure. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this
Paragraph 20, including, but not limited to, reasonable attomeys' fees and costs of title evidence.
For any event of acceleration under Paragraph 9, in addition to any other remedy provided by law, Lender may invoke the power i

changes, the new adjusted interest rate will be applied to the total outstanding principal balance. Each adjustnrent to the interest
Oregon 2“d Deed of Trust 6

rate will be based upon the weekly average yield on United States Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year
("Index")plus a margin. The Index is published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and made available by the United States Treasury
Department in Statistical Release H.l5(5l9). If the Index is no longer available, Lender will be required to use any index
prescribed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The new index will have a historical movement substantially
similar to the original index, and the new index and margin will result in an annual percentage rate that is substantially similar to
the rate in effect at the time the original index becomes unavailable.
Lender will perform the calculations described below to detennine the new adjusted interest rate. The interest rate may change on
August l, 2008, and on the first day of ___ and on that day of each succeeding year, or L the first day of each succeeding
month (Change Date) until the loan is repaid in full.
The value of the Index will be determined, using the most recent Index figure available thirty (30) days before the Change Date
("Current Index"). Before each Change Date, the new interest rate will be calculated by adding a margin to the Current Index.
The sum of the margin plus the Current Index will be called the "Calculated Interest Rate" for each Change Date. The Calculated
Interest Rate will be compared to the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the current Change Date (the "Existing Interest
Rate).
__ Annually Adjusting Variable Rate Feature - The interest rate will never increase or decrease by more than
two percentage points (2.0%) on any single Change Date. The interest rate will never be more than tive
percentage points (5.0%) higher or lower than the initial interest rate stated in Paragraph 2 of this Note.
_; Monthly Adjusting Variable Rate Feature - The Calculated Interest Rate will neverincrease above 13.590%.
The Calculated Interest Rate will be adjusted if necessary to comply with the rate limitation(s) described above and will be in
effect until the next Change Date. At any change date, if the Calculated Interest Rate equals the Existing Interest Rate, the interest
rate will not change.
23. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request Trustee to reconvey the
Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt secured by this Secruity Instrument to Trustee.
Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty and without charge to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such
person or persons shall pay any recordation costs.
24. Substitute Trustee. Lender may from time to time remove Trustee and appoint a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed
hereunder. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title, power and duties conferred
I upon trustee herein and by applicable law.  
  25. Attorneys' Fees. As used in this Security Instrument and in the Note, "attomeys' fees" shall include any attomeys' fees
  awarded by an appellate court.
I 26. Obligatory Loan Advances. Lender's responsibility to make Loan Advances under the terms of the Loan Agreement,
including Loan Advances of principal to Borrower as well as Loan Advances for interest, MIP, Servicing Fees, and other charges
