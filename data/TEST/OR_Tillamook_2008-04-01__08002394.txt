Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and
assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly fumish to Lender all notices of amounts to
be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives
Borrower's obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower's
obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be
in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts
due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires,
shall himish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require.
Borrower's obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to
be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and agreement"
is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and
Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9
and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such
amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in
accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in
such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply
the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can
require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and
reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable
Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in
any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time
specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, armually
analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the
Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing
or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower
any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest
shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the
Funds as required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to
Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow,
as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to
Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12
monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall
notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make
up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund
to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions
attributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or
ground rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To
the extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the marmer provided in Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a marmer acceptable
to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith
by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to
prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings
are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating
the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is s  `ect to a lien
which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a no  entifyin the

the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in
Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may tile, negotiate and settle any available insurance
claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the
insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day
period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under
Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance
proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and
(b) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by
Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the
coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or
to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal
residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the
Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender
otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating
circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not
destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the
Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in
order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is
determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall
promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If insurance or
condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower
shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such
purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of
progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient
to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower's obligation for the completion of
such repair or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has
reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give
Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application
process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower's
knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender
(or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material
representations include, but are not limited to, representations conceming Borrower's occupancy of the
Property as Borrower's principal residence.
9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If
(a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there
is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under

O- ' • O

to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower
or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against
any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify
amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original
Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or
remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or
Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or
preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants
and agrees that Borrower's obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who
co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co—signer"): (a) is co—signing this
Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co—signer's interest in the Property under the
terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or
make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the
co—signer's consent.
Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes
Borrower‘s obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain
all of Borrower‘s rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from
Borrower‘s obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in
writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in
Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with
Borrower's default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this
Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, attomeys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees.
In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific
fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge
fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the
permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the
charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted
limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal
owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the
reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a
prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by
direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out
of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument
must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to
have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's
notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers
unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address
unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly
notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's
change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure.
There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any
notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address
stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in
connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually
received by Lender. If any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable
Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security
Instrument. Y

requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is
serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations
to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not
assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an
individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this
Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by
reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such
notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the
other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If
Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time
period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and
opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to
Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective
action provisions of this Section 20.
21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those
substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Enviromnental Law and the
following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides
and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or fomialdehyde, and radioactive materials;
(b) "Environmental Law " means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that
relate to health, safety or enviromnental protection; (c) "Enviromnental Cleanup" includes any response
action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Enviromnental Law; and (d) an "Enviromnental
Condition" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental
Cleanup.
Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous
Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do,
nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Enviromnental
Law, (b) which creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a
Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding
two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of
Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to
maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit
or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Enviromnental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any
Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of
release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) airy condition caused by the presence, use or release of a
Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified
by any govermnental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation
of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary
remedial actions in accordance with Enviromnental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on
Lender for an Enviromnental Cleanup.

You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost of this
insurance may be added to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your contract or
loan balance, the interest rate on the underlying contract or loan will apply to this added
amount. The effective date of coverage may be the date your prior coverage lapsed or the date
you failed to provide proof of coverage.
The coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance you can
obtain on your own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or any
mandatory liability insurance requirements imposed by Applicable Law.
BY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this
Security Instrument and in any Rider executed by Borrower and recorded with it.
