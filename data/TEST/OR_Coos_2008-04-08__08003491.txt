Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.

lc) Notice to Lender. Borrower shall notify Lender whenever any of the events listed in
this Paragraph (a) (ii) or (b) occur.

subsequent to SIXTY DAYS from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option may not be exercised by Lender when the

proceeding shall be added to the principal balance. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security
Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required
immediate payment in full. However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender
has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years
immediately preceding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding. (ii) reinstatement
will preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely affect
the priority of the Security Instrument.
12. Lien Status. _ _ _ _ _
(a) Modification. Borrower agrees to extend this Security Instrument in accordance with this
Paragraph 12(a). lf Lender determines that the original lien status of the Security Instrument
is jeopardized under state law (including but not limited to situations where the amount
secured by the Security Instrument equals or exceeds the maximum principal amount stated
or the maximum period under which loan advances retain the same lien priority initially
granted to loan advances has expired) and state law permits the original lien status to be
maintained for future loan advances through the execution and recordation of one or more
documents, then Lender shall obtain title evidence at Borrower’s expense. If the title
evidence indicates that the Property is not encumbered by any liens (except this Security
Instrument, the Second Security Instrument described in Paragraph 13(a) and any
subordinate liens that the Lender determines will also be subordinate to any future
loan advances), Lender shall request the Borrower to execute any documents necessary to
protect the lien status of future loan advances. Borrower agrees to execute such
documents. lf state law does not permit the original lien status to be extended to future loan
advances, Borrower will be deemed to have failed to have performed an obligation under
this Security Instrument.
(b) Tax Deferral Programs. Borrower shall not participate in a real estate tax deferral
program, if any liens created by the tax deferral are not subordinate to this Security
Instrument.
(cl Prior Liens. Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this
Security Instrument unless Borrower: (al agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation
secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by,
or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in the Lender’s
opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the
Property; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender
subordinating the lien to all amounts secured by this Security Instrument. lf Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over
this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower
shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above within 10 days of
the giving of notice.
13. Relationship to Second Security Instrument.
la) Second Security Instrument. In order to secure payments which the Secretary may make
to or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to Section 255(i)(1)(A) of the National Housing Act
and the Loan Agreement, the Secretary has required Borrower to execute a Second Note
and a Second Security Instrument on the Property.
(bl Relationship of First and Second Security Instruments. Payments made by the Secretary
shall _not be included in the debt under the Note unless:
(i) This Security Instrument is assigned to the Secretary; or
gi) The Secretary accepts reimbursement by the Lender for all payments made by the
ecretary.
If the circumstances described in (i) or (ii) occur, then all payments by the Secretary,
including interest on the payments, but excluding late charges paid by the Secretary, shall
be included in the debt under the Note.
(cl Effect on Borrower. Where there is no assignment or reimbursement as described in
(b)(i) or (ii) and the Secretary makes payments to Borrower, then Borrower shall not:
(i) Be required to pay amounts owed under the Note, or pay any rents and revenues of
the Property under Paragraph 19 to Lender or a receiver of the Property, until the
Secretary has required payment in full of all outstanding principal and accrued interest
under the Second Note; or
(ii) Be obligated to pay interest or shared appreciation under the Note at any time,
whether accrued before or after the payments by the Secretary, and whether or not
accrued interest has been Included in the principal balance under the Note.
