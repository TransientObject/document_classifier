aclvztnccs throtigh the execution and recordation of one or more documents. then Lender shall obtain title evidence at

change on August l, 2008, and on the lirst day of ___, and on that day ofeach succeeding ycar, or ..,X.~ thc tirst day
ofeach succeeding month (Change Date) until the loan is repaid in full.

Change Date ("Current Index"). lélelore each Change Date, the new interest rate will be calculated by adding a margin
to the Current Index. The sum ofthe margin plus the Current Index will be called the "Calculated Interest Rate" tor
each Change Date. The Calculated Interest Rate will be compared to the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the
current Change Date (the "Existing Interest Rate).
__ Annually Adjusting Variable Rate Feature - The interest rate will never increase or decrease by
more than two percentage points (2.0%) on any single Change Date. The interest rate will never
be more than tive percentage points (5.0%) higher or lower than the initial interest rate stated in
Paragraph 2 of this Note.
-l~L Monthly Adjusting Variable Rate Feature · The Calculated Interest Rate will never increase
above I4.260%.
The Calculated Interest Rate will be adjusted if necessary to comply with the rate liniitation(s) described above and will
be in effect until the next Change Date. At any change date, ifthe Calculated Interest Rate equals the Existing Interest
Rate, the interest rate will not change
