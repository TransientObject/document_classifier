Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the
Note or at such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions
in Section 15. Lender may retum any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments
are insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment
insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights
to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such
payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its
scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on tmapplied funds. Lender may hold such
unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so
within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If
not applied earlier, such fimds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note
irrnnediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future
against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security
Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this
Section 2, all payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of
priority: (a) interest due under the Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under
Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became
due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts due
under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance ofthe Note.
If Lender receives a payment nom Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which
includes a sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent
payment and the late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any
payment received hom Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments ifQ and to the extent that,
each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to
the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges
due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in
the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due
under the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic
Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic
Payments are due under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the “Funds") to provide for
payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over
this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or grotmd
rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section
5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of
the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These
items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may
require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower,
and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to  
Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for i
Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower’s obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow
Items. Lender may waive Borrower’s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at
any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay
directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds
has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such

payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower’s obligation to make such
payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement
contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. If
Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the
amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount
and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender
may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with
Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts,
that are then required under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amormt (a) sufficient to permit Lender
to apply the Frmds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a
lender can require under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of
current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of fixture Escrow Items or otherwise in
accordance with Applicable Law. (
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, ,
instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) I
or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Ftmds to pay the Escrow Items no later
than the time specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the
( Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays
. Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an
r agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall
l not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree
r in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Fimds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without
  charge, an annual accounting of the Frmds as required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account
to Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in
escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower
shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in
no more than 12 monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defmed under
RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the
amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than l2
monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly
refrmd to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fmes, and
impositions attributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument,
leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees,
and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in
the manner provided in Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrrunent
unless Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner
acceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien
in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender’s .
opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only
rmtil such proceedings are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement
satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any
part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender

may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on which that notice is
given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above in this Section
4.
Lender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or
reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan.
5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or
hereafter erected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term
"extended coverage," and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for
which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including
deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the
preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the
insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender’s right to disapprove Borrower’s choice,
which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection
with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking
services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and
subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such
determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone
determination resulting Hom an objection by Borrower.
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain
insurance coverage, at Lender’s option and Borrower’s expense. Lender is under no obligation to
purchase any particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but
might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower’s equity in the Property, or the contents of the
Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was
previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might
significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed
by Lender imder this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security
Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall
be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to
Lender’s right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name
Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the
policies and renewal certificates. lf Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all
receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage,
not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall
include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss
payee.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender.
Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower
otherwise agree in writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the imderlying insurance was
required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair
is economically feasible and Lender’s security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration
period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity
to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender’s satisfaction, provided that
such inspection shall be. tmdertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and P —
restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an
agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance

proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds.
Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the
insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not I
economically feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied I
to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid
l to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.  
y If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available i
I insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from (
  Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the  
l claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires
the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower’s rights
i to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts rmpaid under the Note or this `
I Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower’s rights (other than the right to any refrmd of
uneamed premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as
such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds
either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amormts unpaid under the Note or this Security
Instrument, whether or not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower’s
principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to
occupy the Property as Borrower’s principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy,
unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless
extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower’s control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections.
Borrower shall not destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit
waste on the Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain
the Property in order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its
condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically
feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or
damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid III connection with damage to, or the taking
of} the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender
has released proceeds for such pru·poses. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration
in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or
condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of
Borrower’s obligation for the completion of such repair or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it
has reasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender
shall give Borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such
reasonable cause. s
8. Borrower’s Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if; during the Loan
application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with
Borrower’s lmowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or
statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the
Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning Borrower’s .
occupancy of the Property as Borrower’s principal residence. .
9. Protection of Lender’s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security
Instrument. If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security
Instrmnent, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender’s interest in the

Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for p
condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security ,
Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender i
may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender’s interest in the Property  
and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the l
i Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender’s actions can include, but are not limited
i to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b)
y appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to protect its interest in the Property
l and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding.
l Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change
. locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or other code
  violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take
l action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do
so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this
  Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of
Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from
the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower
requesting payment.
If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of
the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge
unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of
making the Loan, Borrower shall pay the premiiuns required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in
effect. If, for any reason, the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available
from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make
separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the
premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in
effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously
in effect, from an altemate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage
Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender the amount of the
separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect.
Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage
Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is
ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on
such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage
(in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again
becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the
premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making
the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for
Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in
effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender’s requirement for Mortgage Insurance
ends in accordance with- any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such .
temiination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects
Borrower’s obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.

Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain
losses it may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the
Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time,
and may enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses.
These agreements are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the i
other party (or parties) to these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to
. make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may (
i include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).  
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any
  reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) l
l amounts that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower’s payments for  
i Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer’s risk, or reducing  
( losses. lf such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer’s risk in
( exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed "captive
reinsurance." Further:
(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to
· pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase
the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any
refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with
respect to the Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other
law. These rights may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain
cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated
automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were
unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.
11. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds
are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.
If the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or
repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender’s security is not
lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such
Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the
work has been completed to Lender’s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken
promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of
progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable
Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay
Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not
economically feasible or Lender’s security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be
applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if
any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in
Section 2.
In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous .
Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due,
with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which thefair
market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal
to or greater than the amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the

partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the
sums secured by this Security Instrtunent shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous
Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately
before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the
Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid
A to Borrower.
i In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair
( market value ofthe Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less
I than the amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in
i value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be
j applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.
  If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if} after notice by Lender to Borrower that the .
l Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, .
( Borrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days aiier the date the notice is given, Lender is
  authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the
Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing l
Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom  
Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds. i
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun
that, in Lender’s judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of
Lender’s interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a `
default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or
proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender’s judgment, precludes forfeiture of the
Property or other material impairment of Lender’s interest in the Property or rights under this Security
Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of
Lender’s interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall
be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the
time for payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument
granted by Lender to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the
liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to
corrunence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for
payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason
of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any
forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender’s
acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in
amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or
remedy.
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound.
Borrower covenants and agrees that Borrower’s obligations and liability shall be joint and several.
However, any Borrower who co—signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-
signer"): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer’s
interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; Go) is not personally obligated to
pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower
can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this
Security Instrument or the Note without the co-signer’s consent.

SEEURITY TITLE GUARANTY INC
Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes
Borrower’s obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall
obtain all of Borrower’s rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be
released from Borrower’s obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees
to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind
(except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in
connection with Borrower’s default, for the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest in the Property and
rights under this Secruity Instrument, including, but not limited to, attomeys’ fees, property inspection
and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security
Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging
of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by
Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximmn loan charges, and that law is fmally
interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the
Loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from
Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make
this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower.
If a ref11nd reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any
prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower’s
acceptance of any such refimd made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any
right of` action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Secmity
Instrument must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Secmity Instrument
shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually
delivered to Borrower’s notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall
constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice
address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by
notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower’s change of address. If Lender
specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower’s change of address, then Borrower shall only report a
change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address
under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or
by mailing it by first class mail to Lender’s address stated herein unless Lender has designated another
address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be
deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by this
Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will
satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument
shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All
rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and
limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree
by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against
agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note
conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security
histrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.

i corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and
include the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation ·
( to take any action.
  17. Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this

18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this T
Section 18, “Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including,
but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, i
installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower ,
at a future date to a purchaser.
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without
Lender’s prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by
this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is
prohibited by Applicable Law. ,
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice
shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with
Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower
fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies
permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.
19. Borrower’s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain
conditions, Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued i
at any time prior to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of
sale contained in this Secruity Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for
the termination of Borrower’s right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security
Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due
under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of
any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security
Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attomeys’ fees, property inspection and valuation
fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest in the Property and rights
under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure
that Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower’s
obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security hrstrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may
require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following
forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s
check or cashier’s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are
insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon I
reinstatement by Borrower, this Security hrstrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully
effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case
of acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a
partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times
without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan ·
Servicer") that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and
performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and
Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes ofthe Loan Servicer tmrelated to a sale of

the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the
change whichwill state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments
‘ should be made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of
servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the
purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan
Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser
unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as
either an individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party’s actions pursuant
to this Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any
duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other
party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged
breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take
corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action
can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The
notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice
of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and
opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.
21. · Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are
those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law
and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroletun products, toxic
pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and
radioactive materials; (b) "Environmenta1 Law” means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where
the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection; (c) "Environmental
Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defmed in

Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any
Hazardous Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property.
Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in
violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due
to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the
value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on
the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be
appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to,
hazardous substances in consumer products).
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand,
lawsuit or other action by any govemmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the
Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual
knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking,
discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the
presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If
Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that .
any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary,
Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law.
Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an Enviromnental Cleanup.

(c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the

further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration, the right to bring a court
action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration

limited to, reasonable Trustee’s and attorneys’ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to it or to the clerk of the
superior court of the county in which the sale took place.
