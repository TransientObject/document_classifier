Instrument as the "Property." Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the
interests granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument; brit, if necessary to comply with law or custom,
MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of
those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any
action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing or canceling this Security Instrument. »
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has
the right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of
record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands,
subject to any encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non—uniform
covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real
property.
UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
1. Payment of Principal, Interest and Late Charge. Borrower shall pay when due the principal ot`,
and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and late charges due under the Note.
2. Monthly Payments of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. Borrower shall include in each
monthly payment, together with the principal and interest as set forth in the Note and any late charges, a sum
of any (a) taxes and special assessments levied or to be levied against the Property, (b) leasehold payments or
ground rents on the Property, and (c) premiums for insurance required by paragraph 4. In any year in which
the Lender must pay a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
("Secretary"), or in any year in which such premium would have been required if Lender still held the
Security Instrument, each monthly payment shall also include either; (i) a sum for the annual mortgage
insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary, or (ii) a monthly change instead of a mortgage
insurance premium if this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary, in a reasonable amount to be
determined by the Secretary. Except for the monthly charge by the Secretary, these items are called "ljscrow
Items" and the sums paid to Lender are called "Escrow Funds."
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that may be required for Borrower’s escrow account under the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. Section 2601 et seq. and implementing regulations, 24 CFR
Part 3500, as they may be amended from time to time ("RESPA"), except that the cushion or reserve
permitted by RESPA for unanticipated disbursements or disbursements before the Borrower’s payments are
available in the account may not be based on amounts due for the mortgage insurance premium.
If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Items exceed the amounts permitted to be held by
RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. If the amounts of
funds held by Lender at any time are not suilicient to pay the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify the
Borrower and require Borrower to make up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.
The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security tor all sums secured by this Security
Instrument. If Borrower tenders to Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower’s account shall be
credited with the balance remaining for all installment items, (a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage insurance
prerniurn installment that Lender has not become obligated to pay to the Secretary, and Lender shall promptly
refund any excess funds to Borrower. Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of the Property or its acquisition
by Lender, Borrower’s account shall be credited with any balance remaining for all installment for items (a),
(b), and (c).
3. Application of Payments. All payments under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied by Lender as
follows:
gmt, to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly
charge by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance prerniurn;
Second, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and nre, flood and
other hazard insurance premiums, as required;
Third, to interest due under the Note;
Fourth, to amortization of the principal ofthe Note; and

the Secretary. All insurance shall be carried with companies approved by Lender. 'l`he insurance policies and
any renewals shall be held by Lender and shall include loss payable clauses in favor of, and in a fomr
acceptable to, Lender.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Each insurance company concemed is hereby authorized and
directed to make payment for such loss directly to Lender, instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly. All
or any part of the insurance proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either (a) to the reduction ofthe
indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order
in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal, or (b) to the restoration or repair of the damaged
Property. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date ofthe
monthly payments which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess
insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this
Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.

extinguishes the indebtedness, all right, title and interest of Bonower in and to insurance policies in force
shall pass to the purchaser. ·
5. Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Borrower’s Loan
Application; Leaseholds. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower’s principal
residence within sixty days after the execution of this Security Instrument (or within sixty days of a later sale
or transfer of the Property) and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower’s principal residence for at
least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that requirement will cause undue
hardship for Borrower, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower’s control.
Borrower shall notify Lender of any extenuating circumstances. Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy,
damage or substantially change the Property or allow the Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear
excepted. Lender may inspect the Property if the Property is vacant or abandoned or the loan is in default.
Lender may take reasonable action to protect and preserve such vacant or abandoned Property. Borrower
shall also be in default if Borrower, during the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate
information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with any rnatcrial information) in
connection with the loan evidenced by the Note, including, but not limited to, representations concerning
Borrower’s occupancy of the Property as a principal residence. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold,
Borrower shall comply with the provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the
leasehold and fee title shall not be merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
6. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in
connection with any condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in place oi`
condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender to the extent of the full amount of the
indebtedness that remains unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument. Lender shall apply such
proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any
delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal. Any
application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date ofthe monthly
payments, which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess
proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security
Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
7. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender’s Rights in the Property. Borrower shall pay
all governmental or municipal charges, fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2. Borrower
shall pay these obligations on time directly to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure to pay would
adversely affect Lender’s interest in the Property, upon Lender’s request Borrower shall promptly furnish to
Lender receipts evidencing these payments.

4452503835
If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to
perform any other covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal
proceeding that may significantly affect Lender’s rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy,
for condemnation or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to
protect the value of the Property and Lender’s rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard
insurance and other items mentioned in paragraph 2.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of Borrower
and be secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement
at the Note rate, and at the option of Lender shall be immediately due and payable.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Irrstrurnent unless
Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to
Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement ofthe lien in, legal proceedings
which in the Lender’s opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien, or (c) secures from the holder
of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender
determines that any part of the property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security
Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take
one or more of the actions set forth above within 10 days of the giving of notice.
8. Fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.
(a) Default. Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary in the case of
payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
Instrument if:
(i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this
Security Instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or
. (ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other
obligations contained in this Security Instrument.
(b) Sale Without Credit Approval. Lender shall, if permitted by applicable law (including
section 34l(d) of the Gam-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C.
170 I j—3(d)) and with the prior approval of the Secretary, require immediate payment in full of
all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) All or part of the Property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of thc
Property, is sold or otherwise transferred (other than by devise or descent) and
(ii) The Property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal
residence, or the purchaser or grantee does so occupy the Property but his or her credit has
not been approved in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary.
(c) No Waiver. If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require immediate payment
in full, but Lender does not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights with
respect to subsequent events.
(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary. In many circumstances regulations issued by the Secretary
will limit Lender’s rights in the case of payment defaults, to require immediate payment in full
and foreclose if not paid. This Security Instrument does not authorize acceleration or
foreclosure if not permitted by regulations of the Secretary.
(e) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that should this Security Instrument and the Note
are not to be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 60 days from the
date hereof, Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by
this Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary dated
subsequent to 60 days from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security Instrument and the
Note shall be deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
option may not be exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is solely due to
Lender’s failure to remit a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary.

4452503835
10. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate payment
in full because of Borrower’s failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This
right applies even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower
shall tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower’s account current including, to the extent
they are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and
customary attorneys’ fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon
reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in ciiect
as if Lender has not required immediate payment in full. However, Lender is not required to permit
reinstatement if: (i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings
within two years immediately proceeding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding, (ii)
reinstatement will preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely
aifect the priority of the lien created by this Security Instrument.
11. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension ofthe time ot`
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender
to any successor in interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original Borrower or
Borrower’s successor in interest. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any
successor in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums
secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower’s
successors in interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of
or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
12. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co—Signers. 'I`he covenants and
agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and
Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(b). Borrower’s covenants and agreements shall be joint
and several. Any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note: (a) is co—
signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower’s interest in the Property
under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this
Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, iorbear
or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that
Borrower’s consent.
13. Notices. Any notice to Borrower provided for in this Security Instrument shall be given by
delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail unless applicable law requires use of another method. The
notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other address Borrower designates by notice to
Lender. Any notice to Lender shall be given by first class mail to Lender’s address stated herein or any
address Lender designates by notice to Borrower. Any notice provided for in this Security Instrurncnt shall be
deemed to have been given to Borrower or Lender when given as provided in this paragraph.
14. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal law and
the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this
Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not afiect other provisions
of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision, To this
end the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.
15. Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this Security
Instrument.
16. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage,
or release of any Hazardous Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to

Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of
the Property.
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or
other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge. If Borrower learns, or
is notified by any govemmental or regulatory authority, that any removal or other remediation of any

17. Assignment of Rents. Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents

Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after
giving notice of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at any
time there is a breach. Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate any other
right or remedy of Lender. This assignment of rents of the Property shall terminate when the debt secured by
the Security Instrument is paid in full.
18. Foreclosure Procedure. If Lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9,
Lender may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law. Lender shall be
entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph 18, including, but
not limited to, reasonable attomeys’ fees and costs of title evidence.

cause such notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is located. Lender or
Trustee shall give notice of sale in the manner prescribed by applicable law to Borrower and to other persons
prescribed by applicable law. After the time required by applicable law, 'I`rustee, without demand on
Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place and under the
terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee

previously scheduled sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.
Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee’s deed conveying the Property without any covenant or
warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee’s deed shall be prima facie evidence ofthe truth of
the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (a) to all
expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee’s and attomeys’ fee; (b) to all sums
