The beneficiary of this Security Instrument is MERS (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender' s successors and
assigns) and the successors and assigns of MERS. This Security Instrument secures to Lender: (i) the repayment of
the Loan, and all renewals, extensions and modifications of the Note; and (ii) the performance of Borrower's
covenants and agreements under this Security Instrument and the Note. For this purpose, Borrower irrevocably grants
and conveys to Trustee, in trust, with power of sale, the following described property located in the
COUNTY of DESCHUTES :

TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements,
appurtenances, and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be
covered by this Security Instrument. All ofthe foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the "Property."
Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security
Instrument, but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender' s successors
and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose
and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and canceling
this Security Instrument.
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right
to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record.
Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any
encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants with
limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property.
UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
l. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges. Borrower shall
pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any prepayment charges and late
charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items pursuant to Section 3. Payments due
under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S. currency. However, if any check or other
instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid,
Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in

I one or more ofthe following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check,
1 treasurer' s check or cashier' s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured
by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such other
location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section I4. Lender may return
any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender
may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights
hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not
obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of
its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds
until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of
time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be
applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim
which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due
under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security
Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments
accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the Note;
(b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic
Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late charges, second
to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note.
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a sufficient
amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. If
, more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the
l repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that
any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may
be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then
as described in the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note
shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the
Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and
assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the
Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; and (c) premiums for any and all insurance
required by Lender under Section 5. These items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any time during
the term of the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be
escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly
furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for
Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower' s obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may
waive Borrower' s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may
only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts
due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall
furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's
obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and
agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. lf
Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due
for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be
obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow
Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section I4 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to
Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.

j Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds
at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA.
Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures
of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or
entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan
Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender
shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying
the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make
such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds,
Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree
in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an
annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for
the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA,
Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make
up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than I2 monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of
Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower
shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than
I2 monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower
any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to
the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground rents on the
Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items
are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided In Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower:
(a) agrees in writing to the payment ofthe obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only
so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against
enforcement ofthe lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender' s opinion operate to prevent the enforcement ofthe lien
while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder
of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument,
Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within I0 days of the date on which that notice is given,
Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.
Lender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service
used by Lender in connection with this Loan.
5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the
Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards
including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be
maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender
requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term ofthe Loan. The insurance carrier providing
the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender' s right to disapprove Borrower' s choice, which right shall
not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-
time charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for f`lood zone
determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which
reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of
any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone
determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.

2 If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at
Lender' s option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount
of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower's
equity in the Property, or the contents ofthe Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater
or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so
obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed
by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These
amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest,
upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender' s right to
disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an
additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires,
Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any
form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such
policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss
payee.
ln the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make
proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any
insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration
or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender' s security is not lessened.
During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender
has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction,
provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and
restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement
is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be
required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties,
retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower.
If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender' s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds
shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid
to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
lf Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and
related matters. lf Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has
offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the
notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 2I or otherwise, Borrower hereby
assigns to Lender (a) Borrower' s rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid
under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower' s rights (other than the right to any refund
of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights
are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the
Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence
within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower' s
principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower' s
control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not destroy,
damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not
Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from
deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or
restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further
deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking

l
l of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released
proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in
a series of progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient
to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower' s obligation for the completion of such repair
or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections ofthe Property. If it has reasonable cause,
Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time
of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process,
Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower' s knowledge or consent gave
materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with
material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to,
representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as Borrower' s principal residence.
9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a)
Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal
proceeding that might significantly affect Lender' s interest in the Property and/ or rights under this Security Instrument
(such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may
attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the
Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the
Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property,
and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender' s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums
secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable
attorneys' fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured
position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to
make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or
other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off Although Lender may take action
under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that
Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this
Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be
payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
lf this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease.
Borrower shall not surrender the leasehold estate and interests herein conveyed or terminate or cancel the ground lease.
Borrower shall not, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the ground lease. If Borrower
acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger
in writing.
I0. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby assigned to
and shall be paid to Lender.
lf the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair ofthe Property,
if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and
restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an
opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender' s satisfaction, provided that
such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement
or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable
Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any
interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. lf the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or
Lender' s security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security
Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall
be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value ofthe Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be
applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to
Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of
the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount
of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value,
unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced
by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums
secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value ofthe
Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of
the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums
secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise
agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether
or not the sums are then due.
If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party (as
defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to
Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous
Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether
or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party
against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender' s
judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender' s interest in the Property
or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate
as provided in Section I8, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's
judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender' s interest in the Property or
rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the
impairment of Lender' s interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in the
order provided for in Section 2.
ll. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for payment or
modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower or any
Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest
of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower
or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security
Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any
forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of
payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then
due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
I2. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrees
that Borrower' s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security
Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-signer"): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage,
grant and convey the co-signer's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not
personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other
Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security
Instrument or the Note without the co-signer' s consent.
Subject to the provisions of Section I7, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower's
obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower' s rights
and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower' s obligations and liability
under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this
Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 19) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.

13. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower' s
default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument,
including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the
absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed
as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security
Instrument or by Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the
interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits,
then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit;
and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower.
Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment
to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any
prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower' s acceptance of
any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might
have arising out of such overcharge.
14. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in
writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to
Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other
means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires
otherwise, The notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice
address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower' s change of address. If Lender
specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower' s change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address
through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument
at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender' s
address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection
with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender.
If any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law
requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.
15. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be governed by
federal law and the law ofthe jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations contained in
this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might
explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be
construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security
Instrument or the Note conHicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security
Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding
neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and include the plural and vice
versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.
16. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
17. Transfer of the Property; Acceleration; Assumption. This loan may be declared immediately due and
payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee, unless the acceptability of the
assumption of the loan is established pursuant to Section 3714 of Chapter 37, Title 38, United States Code. The
acceptability of any assumption shall also be subject to the following additional provisions:
(a) Funding Fee: A fee equal to one-half ofl percent of the balance of this loan as of the date
of transfer of the property shall be payable at the time of transfer to the loan holder or its authorized
agent, as trustee for the Department of Veterans Affairs. lf the assumer fails to pay this fee at the
time of transfer, the fee shall constitute an additional debt to that already secured by this instrument,
shall bear interest at the rate herein provided, and at the option of the payee of the indebtedness
hereby secured or any transferee thereof, shall be immediately due and payable. This fee is
automatically waived if the assumer is exempt under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3729(c).

l
' (b) Processing Charge: Upon application for approval to allow assumption of this loan, a
processing fee may be charged by the loan holder or its authorized agent for determining the
creditworthiness of the assumer and subsequently revising the holder's ownership records when an
approved transfer is completed. The amount of this charge shall not exceed the maximum established
by the Department of Veterans Affairs for a loan to which Section 37l4 of Chapter 37, Title 38,
United States Code applies.
(c) Indemnity Liability Assumption: If this obligation is assumed, then the assumer hereby
agrees to assume all of the obligations of the veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and
securing the loan. The assumer further agrees to indemnify the Department of Veterans Affairs to
the extent of any claim payment arising from the guaranty or insurance of the indebtedness created
by this instrument.
lf the acceptability of the assumption of this loan is not established for any reason, and Lender exercises
its option to declare all sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately due and payable, Lender shall
give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date
the notice is given in accordance with Section I4 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may
invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.
18. Borrower's Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall
have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the earliest of: (a)
five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in this Security Instrument; (b) such
other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower' s right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a
judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which
then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default
of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the
purpose of protecting Lender' s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such
action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender' s interest in the Property and rights under this Security
Instrument, and Borrower' s obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged.
Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more ofthe following forms,
as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer' s check or cashier' s check,
provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality
or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations
secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall
not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 17.
19. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the Note
(together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might
result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note
and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security
Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale
of the Note. If there is a change ofthe Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice ofthe change which will
state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other
information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereaiier
the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser ofthe Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations
to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed
by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an individual
litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party' s actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that
alleges that the other party has breached any provision ot] or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument,
until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements
of Section I4) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such

l
notice to take corrective action. lf Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action
can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of
acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 21 and the notice of acceleration given
to Borrower pursuant to Section l7‘ shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action
provisions of this Section 19.
20. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 20: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those substances
defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following substances:
gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents,
materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) "Environmental Law" means federal
laws and laws of thejurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection;
(c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in
Environmental Law; and (d) an "Environmental Condition" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or
otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.
Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances,
or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else
to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an
Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a
condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the
presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized
to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to,
hazardous substances in consumer products).
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other
action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance
or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not
limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any
condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the
Property. lf Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that
any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall
promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any
obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.
NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
21. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following
. Borrower’s breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under
Section 17 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (a) the default; (b) the action
required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by
which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the
notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property. The
notice shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a court
action to assert the non—existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale. If the
default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the
power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all
expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 21, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.
lf Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written notice of
the occurrence of an event of default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold and shall cause
such notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is located. Lender or Trustee shall
give notice of sale in the manner prescribed by Applicable Law to Borrower and to other persons prescribed
by Applicable Law. After the time required by Applicable Law, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall

of all or any parcel of the Property by public announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled
sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.

warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee's deed shall be prima facie evidence of the truth
of the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (a) to all
expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys' fees; (b) to all sums
secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to it.

Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty to the person or persons legally
entitled to it. Such person or persons shall pay any recordation costs. Lender may charge such person or persons a
fee for reconveying the Property, but only if the fee is paid to a third party (such as the Trustee) for services rendered
and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable Law.

Trustee appointed hereunder. Without conveyance ofthe Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title,
power and duties conferred upon Trustee herein and by Applicable Law.

awarded by an appellate court.
25. Protective Advances. This Security Instrument secures any advances Lender, at its discretion, may make
under Section 9 of this Security Instrument to protect Lender' s interest in the Property and rights under this Security
Instrument.
26. Required Evidence of Property Insurance.
WARNING
Unless you provide us with evidence of the insurance coverage as required by our contract or loan
agreement, we may purchase insurance at your expense to protect our interest. This insurance may, but
need not, also protect your interest. lf the collateral becomes damaged, the coverage we purchase may not
pay any claim you make or any claim made against you. You may later cancel this coverage by providing
evidence that you have obtained property coverage elsewhere.
You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost ofthis insurance may be
added to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your contract or loan balance, the interest
rate on the underlying contract or loan will apply to this added amount. The effective date of coverage
may be the date your prior coverage lapsed or the date you failed to provide proof of coverage.
The coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance you can obtain on your
own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or any mandatory liability insurance
requirements imposed by Applicable Law.

which provides insurance coverage in the amounts (including deductible levels), for the periods, and against
loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards, including, but
not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance, then: (i) Lender waives the
provision in Section 3 for the Periodic Payment to Lender ofthe yearly premium installments for property
insurance on the Property; and (ii) Borrower's obligation under Section 5 to maintain property insurance
coverage on the Property is deemed satisfied to the extent that the required coverage is provided by the

a loss to the Property, or to common areas and facilities of the PUD, any proceeds payable to Borrower are
hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Lender shall apply the proceeds to the sums secured by the
Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.
C. Public Liability Insurance. Borrower shall take such actions as may be reasonable to insure
that the Owners Association maintains a public liability insurance policy acceptable in form, amount, and
extent of coverage to Lender.
D. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential,
payable to Borrower in connection with any condemnation or other taking of all or any part of the Property
or the common areas and facilities of the PUD, or for any conveyance in lieu of condemnation, are hereby
assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Such proceeds shall be applied by Lender to the sums secured by the
Security Instrument as provided in Section ll.

prior written consent, either partition or subdivide the Property or consent to: (i) the abandonment or
termination of the PUD, except for abandonment or termination required by law in the case of substantial
destruction by fire or other casualty or in the case of ataking by condemnation or eminent domain; (ii) any
amendment to any provision of the "Constituent Documents" if the provision is for the express benefit of
Lender; (iii) termination of professional management and assumption of self-management of the Owners
Association; or (iv) any action which would have the effect of rendering the public liability insurance
coverage maintained by the Owners Association unacceptable to Lender.
F. Remedies. If Borrower does not pay PUD dues and assessments when due, then Lender may pay
them. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph F shall become additional debt of Borrower
secured by the Security Instrument. Unless Borrower and Lender agree to other terms of payment, these
amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the Note rate and shall be payable, with interest,
, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
