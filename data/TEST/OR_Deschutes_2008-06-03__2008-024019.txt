MODIFICATION. Lender and Grantor hereby modify the Deed of Trust as follows:
Extend maturity date to September 5, 2008. .
CONTINUING VALIDITY. Except as expressly modified above, the terms of the original Deed of Trust shall remain unchanged and in full force
and effect. Consent by Lender to this Modification does not waive Lender's right to require strict performance of the Deed of Trust as changed
above nor obligate Lender to make any future modifications. Nothing in this Modification shall constitute a satisfaction of the promissory note or
other credit agreement secured by the Deed of Trust (the "N0te"). It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable all parties to the Deed of Trust
and all parties, makers and endorsers to the Note, including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing.
Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, shall not be released by virtue of this Modification. lf any person who signed the
original Deed of Trust does not sign this Modification, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Modification is given conditionally,
based on the representation to Lender that the non-signing person consents to the changes and provisions of this Modification or otherwise will
not be released by it. This waiver applies not only to any initial extension or modification, but also to all such subsequent actions.
ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES. The undersigned agrees to pay on demand all of Lender's costs and expenses, including Lender's attorney
fees and legal expenses, incurred in connection with enforcement of this Agreement. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help enforce this
Agreement. Lender may also use attorneys who are salaried employees of Lender to enforce this Agreement. The undersigned shall pay all costs
and expenses of all such enforcement. In the event arbitration, suit, action or other legal proceeding is brought to interpret or enforce this
Agreement, the undersigned agrees to pay all additional sums as the arbitrator or court may adjudge reasonable as Lender's costs,
disbursements, and attorney fees at hearing, trial, and on any and all appeals. As used in this paragraph "Agreement" means the loan
agreement, promissory note, guaranty, security agreement, or other agreement, document, or instrument in which this paragraph is found, even
if this document is also described by another name. Whether or not an arbitration or court action is filed, all reasonable attorney fees and
expenses Lender incurs in protecting its interests and/or enforcing this Agreement shall become part of the Indebtedness evidenced or secured
by this Agreement, shall bear interest at the highest applicable rate under the promissory note or credit agreement, and shall be paid to Lender
by the other party or parties signing this Agreement on demand. The attorney fees and expenses covered by this paragraph include without
limitation all of Lender's attorney fees (including the fees charged by Lender's in—house attorneys, calculated at hourly rates charged by
attorneys in private practice with comparable skill and experience), Lender's fees and expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to
modify, vacate, or obtain relief from any automatic stay), fees and expenses for Lender's post·judgment collection activities, Lender's cost of
searching lien records, searching public record databases, on-line computer legal research, title reports, surveyor reports, appraisal reports,
collateral inspection reports, title insurance, and bonds issued to protect Lender's collateral, all to the fullest extent allowed by law.
WAIVE JURY. All parties hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any party against any
other party.
APPRAISAL. If at any time during the term of this Deed of Trust the Lender, in the reasonable exercise of its judgment, determines that it is
likely that there has been a material adverse change in the value of the Real Property, Lender may obtain, at Borrower's expense, an appraisal of
the Real Property prepared by an appraiser satisfactory to Lender and in a form and substance satisfactory to Lender.

Douglas or Washington County, Oregon, as selected by Lender, in its sole discretion, except and only to the extent of procedural matters related
to Lender's perfection and enforcement of its rights and remedies against the collateral for the loan, if the law requires that such a suit be
brought in another jurisdiction. As used in this paragraph, the term "Agreement" means the promissory note, guaranty, security agreement or
