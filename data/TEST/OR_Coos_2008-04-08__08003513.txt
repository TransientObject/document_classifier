Oregon 97411 [Zip Code] ("Property Address");
TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements,
appurtenances and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be
covered by this Security Instrument. A11 of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the
"Property."
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seized of the estate hereby conveyed and has the
right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of
record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands,
subject to any encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non‘uniform
covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real
property.
Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
UNIFORM COVENANTS.
1. Payment of Principal, Interest and Late Charge. Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and
interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and late charges due under the Note.
2. Monthly Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. Borrower shall include in each
monthly payment, together with the principal and interest as set forth in the Note and any late charges, a sum
for (a) taxes and special assessments levied or to be levied against the Property, (b) leasehold payments or
ground rents on the Property, and (c) premiums for insurance required under paragraph 4. In any year in which
the Lender must pay a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
("Secretary"), or in any year in which such premium would have been required if Lender still held the Security
Instrument, each monthly payment shall also include either: (i) a sum for the annual mortgage insurance
premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary, or (ii) a monthly charge instead of a mortgage insurance
premium if this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary, in a reasonable amount to be determined by the
Secretary. Except for the monthly charge by the Secretary, these items are called "Escrow Items" and the sums
paid to Lender are called "Escrow Punds."
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to exceed
the maximum amount that may be required for Borrower’s escrow account under the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. Section 2601 et seq. and implementing regulations, 24 CFR Part 3500, as
they may be amended from time to time ("RESPA" ), except that the cushion or reserve permitted by RESPA
for unanticipated disbursements or disbursements before the Borrower’s payments are available in the account
may not be based on amounts due for the mortgage insurance premium.

COOS COUNTY CLERK, OREGON TOTAL $71.00 04/ 08/ 2008 #2008-5513

If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Items exceed the amounts permitted to be held by RESPA,
Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. If the amounts of funds held by
Lender at any time are not sufficient to pay the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify the Borrower and
require Borrower to make up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.
The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If
Borrower tenders to Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower’s account shall be credited with the
balance remaining for all installment items (a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage insurance premium installment
that Lender has not become obligated to pay to the Secretary, and Lender shall promptly refund any excess
funds to Borrower. Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of the Property or its acquisition by Lender,
Borrower’s account shall be credited with any balance remaining for all installments for items (a), (b), and
lc).
3. Application of Payments. All payments under paragraphs I and 2 shall be applied by Lender as
follows:
Firg, to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly charge
by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance premium;
Second, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood and other
hazard insurance premiums, as required;
Third, to interest due under the Note;
Fourth, to amortization of the principal of the Note; and
@1, to late charges due under the Note.
4. Fire, Flood and Other Hazard Insurance. Borrower shall insure all improvements on the Property,
whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against any hazards, casualties, and contingencies, including
fire, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for the
periods that Lender requires. Borrower shall also insure all improvements on the Property, whether now in
existence or subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent required by the Secretary. All insurance
shall be carried with companies approved by Lender. The insurance policies and any renewals shall be held by
Lender and shall include loss payable clauses in favor of, and in a form acceptable to, Lender.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof of
loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and directed
to make payment for such loss directly to Lender, instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly. All or any
part of the insurance proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either (a) to the reduction of the
indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order
in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal, or (b) to the restoration or repair of the damaged
Property. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the
monthly payments which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess
insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this
Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
In the event of foreclosure of this Security Instrument or other transfer of title to the Property that
extinguishes the indebtedness, all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to insurance policies in force shall
pass to the purchaser.
5. Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; BorroWer’s Loan
Application; Leaseholds. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower’s principal
residence within sixty days after the execution of this Security Instrument (or within sixty days of a later sale or
transfer of the Property) and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower’s principal residence for at least
one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that requirement will cause undue hardship for
Borrower, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower’s control. Borrower shall
notify Lender of any extenuating circumstances. Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy, damage or
substantially change the Property or allow the Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear excepted.
Lender may inspect the Property if the Property is vacant or abandoned or the loan is in default. Lender may
take reasonable action to protect and preserve such vacant or abandoned Property. Borrower shall also be in
default if Borrower, during the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate information o‘
statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with any material information) in connection with the a

evidenced by the Note, including, but not limited to, representations concerning Borrower’s occupancy of the
Property as a principal residence. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with the
provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and fee title shall not be
merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
6. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in
connection with any condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in place of
condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender to the extent of the full amount of the
indebtedness that remains unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument. Lender shall apply such
proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any
delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal. Any
application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly
payments, which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess proceeds
over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument shall
be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
7. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender’s Rights in the Property. Borrower shall pay all
governmental or municipal charges, fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2. Borrower
shall pay these obligations on time directly to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure to pay would
adversely affect Lender’s interest in the Property, upon Lender’s request Borrower shall promptly furnish to
Lender receipts evidencing these payments.
If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to perform
any other covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that
may significantly affect Lender’s rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, for condemnation
or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of
the Property and Lender’s rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard insurance and other items
mentioned in paragraph 2.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of Borrower and
be secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement, at
the Note rate, and at the option of Lender, shall be immediately due and payable.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to
Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings
which in the Lender’s opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien; or (c) secures from the holder of
the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security
Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one
or more of the actions set forth above within l0 days of the giving of notice.
8. Fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.
(a) Default. Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary, in the case of
payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument
if:
(i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security
Instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or
(ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations
contained in this Security Instrument.
(b) Sale Without Credit Approval. Lender shall, if permitted by applicable law (including Section
34l(d) of the Garn‘ St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C. l70lj‘3(d)) and with
the prior approval of the Secretary, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this
Security Instrument if:

COOS COUNTY CLERK, OREGON TOTAL $71.00 Oi+/ 08/ 2008 #20086513

(i) All or part of the Property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the Property, is
sold or otherwise transferred (other than by devise or descent), and
(ii) The Property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal residence, or the
purchaser or grantee does so occupy the Property but his or her credit has not been approved in
accordance with the requirements of the Secretary.
(c) No Waiver. If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require immediate payment in
full, but Lender does not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights with respect to
subsequent events.
(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary. In many circumstances regulations issued by the Secretary will
limit Lender’s rights, in the case of payment defaults, to require immediate payment in full and
foreclose if not paid. This Security Instrument does not authorize acceleration or foreclosure if not
permitted by regulations of the Secretary.
(e) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that if this Security Instrument and the Note are not
determined to be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 60 days from the date
hereof, Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary dated subsequent to
60 days from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security Instrument and the Note, shall be
deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option may not be
exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is solely due to Lender’s failure to remit a
mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary.
10. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate payment in
full because of Borrower’s failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This right
applies even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower shall
tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower’s account current including, to the extent they
are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary
attorneys` fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by
Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had
not required immediate payment in full. However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i)
Lender has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years
immediately preceding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding, (ii) reinstatement will
preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely affect the priority
of the lien created by this Security Instrument.
ll. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time of
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender
to any successor in interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original Borrower or
Borrower’s successor in interest, Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any successor
in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this
Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower’s successors in
interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the
exercise of any right or remedy.
l2. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-Signers. The covenants and
agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and
Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(b). Borrower’s covenants and agreements shall be joint and
several. Any Borrower who co‘signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note; (a) is co‘signing
this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower’s interest in the Property under the
terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make
any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower’s
consent.
I3. Notices. Any notice to Borrower provided for in this Security Instrument shall be given by
delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail unless applicable law requires use of another method. The
notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other address Borrower designates by notice to Lender.

Any notice to Lender shall be given by first class mail t0 Lender’s address stated herein or any address Lender
designates by notice to Borrower. Any notice provided for in this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have
been given to Borrower or Lender when given as provided in this paragraph.
14. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be governed by Federal law and the
law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this
Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of
this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision. To this end
the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.
15. Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this Security
Instrument.
16. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or
release of any Hazardous Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do,
anything affecting the Property that is in violation of any Environmental Law. The preceding two sentences
shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances
that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property.
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or
other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge. If Borrower learns, or
is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, that any removal or other remediation of any
Hazardous Substances affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial
actions in accordance with Environmental Law.
As used in this paragraph 16, "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous
substances by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic
petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or
formaldehyde, and radioactive materials. As used in this paragraph 16, "Environmental Law" means federal
laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental
protection.
NONIINIEORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
17. Assignment of Rents. Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents and
revenues of the Property. Borrower authorizes Lender or Lender’s agents to collect the rents and revenues and
hereby directs each tenant of the Property to pay the rents to Lender or Lender’s agents. However, prior to
Lender’s notice to Borrower of Borrower’s breach of any covenant or agreement in the Security Instrument,
Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues of the Property as trustee for the benefit of Lender
and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for
additional security only.
If Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by
Borrower as trustee for benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument;
(b) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all of the rents of the Property; and (c) each tenant of the
Property shall pay all rents due and unpaid to Lender or Lender’s agent on Lender’s written demand to the
tenant.
Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perform any act
that would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this paragraph l7.
Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after giving
notice of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at any time there
is a breach. Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate any other right or remedy
of Lender. This assignment of rents of the Property shall terminate when the debt secured by the Security
Instrument is paid in full.

COOS COUNTY CLERK, OREGON TOT/-\L $71.00 0/+/ 08/ 2008 #2008-5513

18. Foreclosure Procedure. If Lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9,
Lender may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law. Lender
shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph
18, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of title evidence.
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written
notice of the occurrence of an event of default and of Lender’s election to cause the Property to be
sold and shall cause such notice to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is
located. Lender or Trustee shall give notice of sale in the manner prescribed by applicable law to
Borrower and to other persons prescribed by applicable law. After the time required by applicable
law, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest
bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more
parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of all or any parcel of the
Property by public announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled sale. Lender or
its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.
Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee’s deed conveying the Property without any
covenant or warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee’s deed shall be prima facie
evidence of the truth of the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in
the following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee’s
and attorneys’ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the
person or persons legally entitled to it.
If the Lender’s interest in this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary and the Secretary
requires immediate payment in full under Paragraph 9, the Secretary may invoke the nonjudicial
power of sale provided in the Single Family Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1994 ("Act") (12 U.S.C.
3751 et seq. ) by requesting a foreclosure commissioner designated under the Act to commence
foreclosure and to sell the Property as provided in the Act. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall
deprive the Secretary of any rights otherwise available to a Lender under this Paragraph 18 or
applicable law.
19. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request
Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt
secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty and
without charge to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or persons shall pay any recordation
costs.
20. Substitute Trustee. Lender may, from time to time, remove Trustee and appoint a successor trustee
to any Trustee appointed hereunder. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to
all the title, power and duties conferred upon Trustee herein and by applicable law.
21. Attorneys’ Fees. As used in this Security Instrument and in the Note, "attorneys’ fees" shall include
any attorneys’ fees awarded by an appellate court.
22. Insurance Warning. Unless you provide us with evidence of the insurance coverage as required by
our contract or loan agreement, we may purchase insurance at your expense to protect our interest. This
insurance may, but need not, also protect your interest. If the collateral becomes damaged, the coverage we
purchase may not pay any claim you make or any claim made against you. You may later cancel this coverage
by providing evidence that you have obtained property coverage elsewhere.
You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost of this insurance may be added
to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your contract or loan balance, the interest rate on the
underlying contract or loan will apply to this added amount. The effective date of coverage may be the date
your prior coverage lapsed or the date you failed to provide proof of coverage.
he coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance you can obtain on your
own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or any mandatory liability insurance
requirements imposed by applicable law.
23. Riders to this Security Instrument. lf one or more riders are executed by Borrower and recorded
together with this Security Instrument, the covenants of each such rider shall be incorporated into and shall
amend and supplement the covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument as if the rider(s) were a part
of this Security Instrument. [Check applicable box(es)l.

WARNING
Unless you (the Borrower) provide us (the Department) with evidence of the insurance coverage as
required by this Deed of Trust, we (the Department) may purchase insurance at your expense to protect our
interest. This insurance may, but need not, also protect your interest. If the collateral (the Trust Property)
becomes damaged, the coverage we purchase may not pay any claim you make or any claim made against
you. You may later cancel this coverage by providing evidence that you have obtained property coverage
elsewhere.

You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost of this insurance may be
added to your loan balance. If the cost is added to your loan balance, the interest rate on the underlying
loan will apply to this added amount. The effective date of coverage may be the date your prior coverage
lapsed or the date you failed to provide proof of coverage.
The coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance you can obtain on your
own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or any mandatory liability insurance
requirements imposed by applicable law.
The Borrower understands and agrees that the above provisions and the interest rate set forth in the Note
shall be in effect only if this loan is purchased by the Department or its assigns. If for any reason it is not
so purchased, or if such purchase is rescinded, then the above provisions shall cease to be effective and the
interest rate may be increased to % per annum, and the monthly installment of principal and L
interest may be increased to $ .
NOTICE TO BORROWER: THIS DOCUMENT SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIES THE TERMS
OF THIS LOAN. DO NOT SIGN IT UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD IT.
I hereby consent to the modifications of the terms of the Deed of Trust and Note which are contained in
this Addendum.
