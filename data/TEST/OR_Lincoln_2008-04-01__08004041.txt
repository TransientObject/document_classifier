option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by federal law or by Oregon law.
TAXES AND LIENS. The following provisions relating to the taxes and liens on the Property are part of this Deed of Trust:
Payment. Grantor shall pay when due (and in all events prior to delinquency) all taxes, special taxes, assessments, charges (including
water and sewer), fines and impositions levied against or on account of the Property, and shall pay when due all claims for work done on or
for services rendered or material furnished to the Property. Grantor shall maintain the Property free of all liens having priority over or equal
to the interest of Lender under this Deed of Trust, except for the lien of taxes and assessments not due, except for the Existing
Indebtedness referred to below, and except as otherwise provided in this Deed of Trust.
Right to Contest. Grantor may withhold payment of any tax, assessment, or claim in connection with a good faith dispute over the
obligation to pay, so long as Lender's interest in the Property is not jeopardized. lf a lien arises or is filed as a result of nonpayment,
Grantor shall within fifteen (15) days after the lien arises or, if a lien is filed, within fifteen (15) days after Grantor has notice of the filing,
secure the discharge of the lien, or if requested by Lender, deposit with Lender cash or a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security
satisfactory to Lender in an amount sufficient to discharge the lien plus any costs and attorneys' fees, or other charges that could accrue
as a result of a foreclosure or sale under the lien. In any contest, Grantor shall defend itself and Lender and shall satisfy any adverse
judgment before enforcement against the Property. Grantor shall name Lender as an additional obligee under any surety bond furnished in
the contest proceedings.
Evidence of Payment. Grantor shall upon demand furnish to Lender satisfactory evidence of payment of the taxes or assessments and shall
authorize the appropriate governmental official to deliver to Lender at any time a written statement of the taxes and assessments against
the Property.
Notice of Construction. Grantor shall notify Lender at least fifteen (15) days before any work is commenced, any services are furnished, or
any materials are supplied to the Property, if any mechanic's lien, materia|men‘s lien, or other lien could be asserted on account of the
work, services, or materials. Grantor will upon request of Lender furnish to Lender advance assurances satisfactory to Lender that Grantor
can and will pay the cost of such improvements.
PROPERTY DAMAGE INSURANCE. The following provisions relating to insuring the Property are a part of this Deed of Trust.
Maintenance of Insurance. Grantor shall procure and maintain policies of fire insurance with standard extended coverage endorsements on
a replacement basis for the full insurable value covering all Improvements on the Real Property in an amount sufficient to avoid application
of any coinsurance clause, and with a standard mortgagee clause in favor of Lender. Grantor shall also procure and maintain
comprehensive general liability insurance in such coverage amounts as Lender may request with Trustee and Lender being named as
additional insureds in such liability insurance policies. Additionally, Grantor shall maintain such other insurance, including but not limited to
hazard, business interruption, and boiler insurance, as Lender may reasonably require. Policies shall be written in form, amounts, coverages
and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender and issued by a company or companies reasonably acceptable to Lender. Grantor, upon request
of Lender, will deliver to Lender from time to time the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender, including
stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least ten (10) days prior written notice to Lender. Each insurance
policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by any act, omission or
default of Grantor or any other person. Should the Real Property be located in an area designated by the Director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as a special flood hazard area, Grantor agrees to obtain and maintain Federal Flood Insurance, if available, within 45
days after notice is given by Lender that the Property is located in a special flood hazard area, for the full unpaid principal balance of the
loan and any prior liens on the property securing the loan, up to the maximum policy limits set under the National Flood Insurance Program,
or as otherwise required by Lender, and to maintain such insurance for the term of the loan.
Application of Proceeds. Grantor shall promptly notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Property. Lender may make proof of loss if
Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty. Whether or not Lender's security is impaired, Lender may, at Lender's
election, receive and retain the proceeds of any insurance and apply the proceeds to the reduction of the Indebtedness, payment of any lien
affecting the Property, or the restoration and repair of the Property. lf Lender elects to apply the proceeds to restoration and repair, Grantor
shall repair or replace the damaged or destroyed Improvements in a manner satisfactory to Lender. Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of
such expenditure, pay or reimburse Grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration if Grantor is not in default
under this Deed of Trust. Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within 180 days after their receipt and which Lender has not
committed to the repair or restoration of the Property shall be used first to pay any amount owing to Lender under this Deed of Trust, then
to pay accrued interest, and the remainder, if any, shall be applied to the principal balance of the Indebtedness. If Lender holds any
proceeds after payment in full of the Indebtedness, such proceeds shall be paid to Grantor as Grantor's interests may appear.
Compliance with Existing Indebtedness. During the period in which any Existing Indebtedness described below is in effect, compliance with
the insurance provisions contained in the instrument evidencing such Existing Indebtedness shall constitute compliance with the insurance
provisions under this Deed of Trust, to the extent compliance with the terms of this Deed of Trust would constitute a duplication of
insurance requirement. If any proceeds from the insurance become payable on loss, the provisions in this Deed of Trust for division of
proceeds shall apply only to that portion of the proceeds not payable to the holder of the Existing Indebtedness.
Grantor's Report on Insurance. Upon request of Lender, however not more than once a year, Grantor shall furnish to Lender a report on
each existing policy of insurance showing: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the
property insured, the then current replacement value of such property, and the manner of determining that value; and (5) the expiration
date of the policy. Grantor shall, upon request of Lender, have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine the cash value
replacement cost of the Property.
LENDER'S EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Property or if Grantor
fails to comply with any provision of this Deed of Trust or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor's failure to comply with
any obligation to maintain Existing Indebtedness in good standing as required below, or to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is

required to discharge or pay under this Deed of Trust or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor's behalf may (but shall not be obligated to)
take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests,
encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Property and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the
Property. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the
date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's
option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any
installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or
(C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity. The Deed of Trust also will secure payment of these
amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default.
WARRANTY; DEFENSE OF TITLE. The following provisions relating to ownership of the Property are a part of this Deed of Trust:

Grantor has the full right, power, and authority to execute and deliver this Deed of Trust to Lender.
Defense of Title. Subject to the exception in the paragraph above, Grantor warrants and will forever defend the title to the Property against
the lawful claims of all persons. In the event any action or proceeding is commenced that questions Grantor's title or the interest of
Trustee or Lender under this Deed of Trust, Grantor shall defend the action at Grantor's expense. Grantor may be the nominal party in
such proceeding, but Lender shall be entitled to participate in the proceeding and to be represented in the proceeding by counsel of
Lender's own choice, and Grantor will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lender such instruments as Lender may request from time to
time to permit such participation.
Compliance With Laws. Grantor warrants that the Property and Grantor's use of the Property complies with all existing applicable laws,
ordinances, and regulations of governmental authorities.
Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations, warranties, and agreements made by Grantor in this Deed of Trust shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Deed of Trust, shall be continuing in nature, and shall remain in full force and effect until such
time as Borrower's Indebtedness shall be paid in full.

consent of Lender. Grantor shall neither request nor accept any future advances under any such security agreement without the prior
written consent of Lender.

Proceedings. lf any proceeding in condemnation is filed, Grantor shall promptly notify Lender in writing, and Grantor shall promptly take
such steps as may be necessary to defend the action and obtain the award. Grantor may be the nominal party in such proceeding, but
Lender shall be entitled to participate in the proceeding and to be represented in the proceeding by counsel of its own choice, and Grantor
will deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender such instruments and documentation as may be requested by Lender from time to time to
permit such participation.
Application of Net Proceeds. lf all or any part of the Property is condemned by eminent domain proceedings or by any proceeding or
purchase in lieu of condemnation, Lender may at its election require that all or any portion of the net proceeds of the award be applied to
the Indebtedness or the repair or restoration of the Property. The net proceeds of the award shall mean the award after payment of all
reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred by Trustee or Lender in connection with the condemnation.
IMPOSITION OF TAXES, FEES AND CHARGES BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. The following provisions relating to governmental taxes,
fees and charges are a part of this Deed of Trust:

Subsequent Taxes. If any tax to which this section applies is enacted subsequent to the date of this Deed of Trust, this event shall have
the same effect as an Event of Default, and Lender may exercise any or all of its available remedies for an Event of Default as provided

financing statement. Grantor shall reimburse Lender for all expenses incurred in perfecting or continuing this security interest. Upon
default, Grantor shall not remove, sever or detach the Personal Property from the Property. Upon default, Grantor shall assemble any
Personal Property not affixed to the Property in a manner and at a place reasonably convenient to Grantor and Lender and make it available
to Lender within three (3) days after receipt of written demand from Lender to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Related Documents.

Death or Insolvency. The dissolution or termination of Borrower's or Grantor's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Borrower or

this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower or Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim
which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower or Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture

provision of this Deed of Trust within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Grantor, after receiving written notice from
Lender demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within ten (10) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than ten (10) days,
immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and
completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical.
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. If an Event of Default occurs under this Deed of Trust, at any time thereafter, Trustee or Lender may
exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies:
Election of Remedies. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make
expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Deed of Trust, after Grantor's failure to perform, shall not
affect Lender's right to declare a default and exercise its remedies.
Accelerate Indebtedness. Lender shall have the right at its option without notice to Borrower or Grantor to declare the entire Indebtedness
immediately due and payable, including any prepayment penalty which Borrower would be required to pay.
Foreclosure. With respect to all or any part of the Real Property, the Trustee shall have the right to foreclose by notice and sale, and
Lender shall have the right to foreclose by judicial foreclosure, in either case in accordance with and to the full extent provided by
applicable law. lf this Deed of Trust is foreclosed by judicial foreclosure, Lender will be entitled to a judgment which will provide that if the
foreclosure sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the judgment, execution may issue for the amount of the unpaid balance of the
judgment.
UCC Remedies. With respect to all or any part of the Personal Property, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party
under the Uniform Commercial Code.
Collect Rents. Lender shall have the right, without notice to Borrower or Grantor to take possession of and manage the Property and
collect the Rents, including amounts past due and unpaid, and apply the net proceeds, over and above Lender's costs, against the
Indebtedness. In furtherance of this right, Lender may require any tenant or other user of the Property to make payments of rent or use
fees directly to Lender. If the Rents are collected by Lender, then Grantor irrevocably designates Lender as Grantor's attorney—in—fact to
endorse instruments received in payment thereof in the name of Grantor and to negotiate the same and collect the proceeds. Payments by
tenants or other users to Lender in response to Lender's demand shall satisfy the obligations for which the payments are made, whether or
not any proper grounds for the demand existed. Lender may exercise its rights under this subparagraph either in person, by agent, or
through a receiver.
Appoint Receiver. Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Property, with the
power to protect and preserve the Property, to operate the Property preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the Rents from the
Property andlapply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness. The receiver may serve without
bond if permitted by law. Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Property
exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount. Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver.
Tenancy at Sufferance. If Grantor remains in possession of the Property after the Property is sold as provided above or Lender otherwise
becomes entitled to possession of the Property upon default of Borrower or Grantor, Grantor shall become a tenant at sufferance of Lender
or the purchaser of the Property and shall, at Lender's option, either (1) pay a reasonable rental for the use of the Property, or (2) vacate
the Property immediately upon the demand of Lender.
Other Remedies. Trustee or Lender shall have any other right or remedy provided in this Deed of Trust or the Note or available at law or in
equity.
Notice of Sale. Lender shall give Grantor reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale of the Personal Property or of the time

given at least fifteen (15) days before the time of the sale or disposition. Any sale of the Personal Property may be made in conjunction
with any sale of the Real Property.
Sale of the Property. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower and Grantor hereby waives any and all rights to have the
Property marshalled. In exercising its rights and remedies, the Trustee or Lender shall be free to sell all or any part of the Property together
or separately, in one sale or by separate sales. Lender shall be entitled to bid at any public sale on all or any portion of the Property.
Attorneys' Fees; Expenses. lf Lender institutes any suit or action to enforce any of the terms of this Deed of Trust, Lender shall be entitled
to recover such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorneys' fees at trial and upon any appeal. Whether or not any court action
is involved, and to the extent not prohibited by law, all reasonable expenses Lender incurs that in Lender‘s opinion are necessary at any
time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of its rights shall become a part of the Indebtedness payable on demand and shall
bear interest at the Note rate from the date of the expenditure until repaid. Expenses covered by this paragraph include, without limitation,
however subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit,
