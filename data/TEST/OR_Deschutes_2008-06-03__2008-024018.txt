and effect. Consent by Lender to this Modification does not waive Lender‘s right to require strict performance of the Deed of Trust as changed
above nor obligate Lender to make any future modifications. Nothing in this Modification shall constitute a satisfaction of the promissory note or
other credit agreement secured by the Deed of Trust (the "Note"). It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable all parties to the Deed of Trust
and all parties, makers and endorsers to the Note, including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing.
Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, shall not be released by virtue of this Modification. lf any person who signed the
original Deed of Trust does not sign this Modification, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Modification is given conditionally,

and expenses of all such enforcement. In the event arbitration, suit, action or other legal proceeding is brought to interpret or enforce this
Agreement, the undersigned agrees to pay all additional sums as the arbitrator or court may adjudge reasonable as Lender's costs,
disbursements, and attorney fees at hearing, trial, and on any and all appeals. As used in this paragraph "Agreement" means the loan
agreement, promissory note, guaranty, security agreement, or other agreement, document, or instrument in which this paragraph is found, even
if this document is also described by another name. Whether or not an arbitration or court action is filed, all reasonable attorney fees and
expenses Lender incurs in protecting its interests and/or enforcing this Agreement shall become part of the Indebtedness evidenced or secured
by this Agreement, shall bear interest at the highest applicable rate under the promissory note or credit agreement, and shall be paid to Lender
by the other party or parties signing this Agreement on demand. The attorney fees and expenses covered by this paragraph include without

searching lien records, searching public record databases, on—line computer legal research, title reports, surveyor reports, appraisal reports,
