amount ofthe late charge shall be as specified in the Note or Loan Agreement or, if the Note or Loan
Agreement specifies no late charge, then five percent (5%) ofthe amount ofthe payment of principal

SECTION 4. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Unless applicable law provides otherwise,
or unless specified to the contrary in the other Loan Documents, each complete installment payment

are due, amounts at least equal to the taxes and assessments to be paid. If Beneficiary determines
that the reserve funds are insufficient at any time, Borrower shall promptly pay any deficiency to
Beneficiary on its demand. The reserve funds shall be held by Beneficiary in a deposit account, and
the funds may be commingled with other funds held by Beneficiary. Unless Beneficiary and
Borrower agree in writing otherwise or applicable law requires that Beneficiary pay Borrower
interest on the funds, Beneficiary shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest on the funds.

not the agent of Borrower for payment of taxes and assessments required to be paid by Borrower.
Upon any Event of Default under this Trust Deed or any other Loan Documents, Beneficiary may

compromise any claim under insurance policies, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from
such insurance policies, to collect and receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct therefrom l

condition or such other condition as Beneficiary may approve in writing. Beneficiary may require
that Borrower deposit with Beneficiary any amount in excess of the insurance proceeds necessary
to complete restoration, which amounts shall be disbursed prior to disbursement of any insurance
proceeds. Unless Beneficiary and Borrower agree in writing otherwise or applicable law requires
that Beneficiary pay Borrower interest on the proceeds, Beneficiary shall not be required to pay
Borrower any interest on the proceeds or any other sum which Beneficiary may require Borrower
to deposit with Beneficiary pursuant to this Section. lf the insurance proceeds are applied to the
payment ofthe sums secured by this Trust Deed, any such application of proceeds to principal shall
be applied to the most remote unpaid installment of principal and shall not extend or postpone the
due dates of any payments required under Section 2 or change the amounts of any such payments.
lf the Property is sold to Beneficiary pursuant to Section 17 of this Trust Deed or if Beneficiary
otherwise acquires title to the Property, then in addition to the lien and security interests otherwise
granted to Beneficiary under this Trust Deed, Beneficiary shall have all of the right, title and

Beneficiary the leases, rents or agreements conceming the Property now existing or in the future

have the right to collect and retain such rents as they become due and payable. Upon Beneficiary's
request, Borrower shall execute any additional documents requested by Beneficiary to assign to
Beneficiary any leases and all security and other deposits concerning the Property. This assignment
is not a delegation or assignment to Beneficiary of Borrower's duties or obligations under or in
connection with the Property. Beneficiary's acceptance of this assignment does not constitute a
promise by it nor does it in any way obligate it to perform any of Borrower's or Borrower’s duties
or obligations under or in connection with the leases, rents or agreements. Borrower hereby agrees
to indemnify Beneficiary against and hold it harmless from any and all liability, loss or damage
which it may or might incur under the leases, rents or agreements or under or by reason of this
assignment and of and from any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be asserted
