TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements,
appurtenances, and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be
covered by this Security Instrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the
"Property." Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by
Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for
Lender and Lender's successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but
not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including,
but not limited to, releasing and canceling this Security Instrument.
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the
right to grant anti convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of
record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands,
subject to any encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform
covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real
property.
UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges.
Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any
prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items
pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S. currency.
However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security
Instrument is retumed to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments due under the
Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following lorms, as selected by Lender: (a)
cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashiers check, provided any such
check is drawn upon an institution who se deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or
(d) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such
other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15. Lender
may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan
current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without
waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future,
but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic
Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender
may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current. lf Borrower does not
do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds or retum them to Borrower. If not
applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior
to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve
Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants
and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments
accepted and applied by Lender shall he applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the
Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each
Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late
charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal
balance of the Note.

If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a sufficient
amount to pay airy late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. lf
more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the
repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that
any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess
may be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges
and then as described in the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the
Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under
the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes
and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance
on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all
insurance requirtxl by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums
payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10. These items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any time during the term of
the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by
Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly fumish to
Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow
Items unless Lender waives Borrower's obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may
waive Borrowers obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver
may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the
amounts due for any Escrow Items hor which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender
requires, shall fumish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may
require. Borrowers obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to
be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and agreement" is
used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower
fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such
amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may
revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and,
upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under
this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the
Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under
RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of
expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.
The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or
entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan
Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA.
Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or
verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits
Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be
paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower
and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to
Borrower, without charge, an annual ac counting of the Funds as required by RESPA.
lf there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower
for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under
RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount
necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments. If
there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required
by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance
with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to
Borrower any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions
attributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground
rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the extent
that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to
Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or
defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to prevent the
enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or
(c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security
Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over
this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on
which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above in
this Section 4.
Lender may require Borrower to pay a one·time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting
service used by Lender in connection with this Loan.

5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the
Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other
hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This
insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender
requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The
insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender's right to disapprove
Borrower’s choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in
connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking
services; or (b) a one-time charge for llood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges
each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such determination or
certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection
by Borrower.
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage.
at Lender's option and Borrowers expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or
amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower,
Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might
provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the
insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have
obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower
secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at th Note rate from the date of
disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender's right to
disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or
as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender
requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower
obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the
Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an
additional loss payee.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may
make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing,
any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applied to
restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is
not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance
proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to
Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds
for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed.
Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance
proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or eamiugs on such proceeds. Fees for
public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and
shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. lf the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's
security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security
Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be
applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and
related matters. lf Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier
has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when
the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower
hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts
unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrowers rights (other than the right to
any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar
as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to
repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or
not then due.
6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrowers principal residence
within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as
Borrowers principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees
in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which
are beyond Borrowers control.
7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not
destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property.
Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the
Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to
Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if
damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeth: are paid in connection
with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the
Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs
and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance
or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of

Borrowers obligation for the completi·on of such repair or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has reasonable
cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice
at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process,
Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower's knowledge or consent
gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender
with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to.
representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence.
9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a)
Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal
proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security
Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a
lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower
has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect
Lender's interest in the Property and rights tmder this Security lnstrurnent, including protecting and/or assessing
the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions can include, but are not
limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing
in court; and (c) paying reasonable attomeys' fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this
Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes,
but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and
windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have
utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so
and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or
all actions authorized under this Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured
by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and
shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease. If
Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to
the merger in writing.
10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan,
Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. I1`, for any reason, the
Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that
previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward
the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage
substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the
cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by
Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue to pay
to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased
to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of
Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be nonrefundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is
ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss
reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and
for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is
obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If
Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make
separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums
required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender's
requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and
Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this
Section 10 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) hir certain losses it may
incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter
into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. 'These agreements are on
terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to these
agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds
that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance
premiums).
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other
entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or
might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or
modifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. lf such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender
takes a share of the insurer's risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is
often termed "captive reinsurance." Further:
(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage
Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will
owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.

(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the
Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may
include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage
Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any
Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.
ll. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.
If the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the
Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened, During such
repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has
had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lenders satisfaction,
provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a
single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made
in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, lender shall not be
required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is
not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to
the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.
Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall
be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid
to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of
the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the
amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or
loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security
Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction:
(a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value
divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in
value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of
the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the
sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender
otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security
Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.
lf the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party
(as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond
to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the
Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security
Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous
Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lenders
judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the
Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has
occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling
that, in tenders judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lenders interest
in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are
attributable to the impairment oi` Lender's interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to
Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in
the order provided for in Section 2.
12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for payment
or modification o1` amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower
or any Successor rn Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors
in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest
of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by
this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of
Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's
acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than
the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
13. Joint and Several Liability; Co··signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and
agrees that Borrower's obligations and jliability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co~sigr1s
this Security Instrument but docs not execute the Note (a ··c0»signer··); (a) is co—signing this Security Instrument
only to mortgage, grant and convey the co~signers interest in the Property under the terms of this Security
Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees
that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with
regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the co-signer's consent.
Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrowers
obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrowers
rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower's obligations

and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and
agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors
and assigns of lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with
Borrower's default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security
Instrument, including, but not limited to, attomeys' fees, property inspection and valuation f`ees. In regard to any
other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall
not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly
prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that
the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted
limits, then: fa) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the
permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be
refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or
by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial
prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the
Note). Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver oi`
any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be
in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been
given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent
by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law
expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a
substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of
address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of address, then Borrower shall only
report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address
under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing
it by first class mail to Lender's address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to
Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to
Lender until actually received by Lender. If` any notice required by this Security Instrunrent is also required
under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this
Security Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be govemed
by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the `Property is located. All rights and obligations
contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law.
Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such
silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or
clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other
provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include
corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and include
the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.
17. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,
"lnterest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to,
those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or escrow
agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a
natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent,
Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this
option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide
a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which
Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. lf Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the
expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further
notice or demand on Borrower.
19. Borrower's Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower
shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the earliest
of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in this Security Instrument;
(b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower's right to reinstate; or (c)
entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all
sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred;
(b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this
Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attomeys‘ fees, property inspection and valuation
fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this
Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest
in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by
this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement
sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c)
certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashiers check, provided any such check. is drawn upon an

institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds
Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain
fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of
acceleration under Section 18.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the
Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A
sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects Periodic Payments due
under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the
Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan
Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. lf there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written
notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which
payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of
servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of
the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be
transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided
by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an
individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security
Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this
Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in
compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a
reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time
period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for
purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to
Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the
notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.
21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those substances
defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following
substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides,
volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) "Environmental
Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or
environmental protection; (c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or
removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) an "Environmental Condition" means a condition that
can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.
Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous
Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor
allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b)
which creates an Environmental Cond.ition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous
Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall
not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are
generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including,
but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or
other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental
Condition, including but not limited l.0, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any
Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance
which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower leams. or is notified by any governmental or
regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance
affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance
with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.
NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following
Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration
under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (rt) the default; (b)
the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to
Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the
date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument and
sale of the Property at public auction at a date not less than 120 days in the future. The notice shall
further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration, the right to bring a court action to
assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale, and any
other matters required to be included in the notice by Applicable Law. If the default is not cured on or
before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option, may require immediate payment in full of all
sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale
and/or any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses
incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including, but not limited to, reasonable
att0rneys' fees and costs of title evidence.

If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall give written notice to Trustee of the occurrence of
an event of default and of Lender‘s election to cause the Property to be sold. Trustee and Lender shall
take such action regarding notice of sale and shall give such notices to Borrower and to other persons as
Applicable Law may require. After the time required by Applicable Law and after publication of the
notice of sale, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the
highest bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more
parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of the Property for a period or

(a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys’ fees; (b) to
all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to
it or to the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the sale took place.
23. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request
Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt
