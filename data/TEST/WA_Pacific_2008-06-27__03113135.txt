Property because of physical or mental illness and the Property is not the principal
residence of at least one other Borrower; or

Paragraph 9 (a)(ii) and (b) occur.

(iii) Sell the Property for the lesser of the balance or 95% of the appraised value and apply
the net proceeds of the sale toward the balance; or
(iv) Provide the Lender with a deed-in—lieu of foreclosure,
(e) Trusts. Conveyance of a i3orrower's interest in the Property to a trust which meets the
requirements of the Secretary, or conveyance of a trust's interests iln the Property to a
Borrower, shall not be considered a conveyance for purposes of this Paragraph 9. A trust shall
not be considered an occupant or be considered as having a principal residence for purposes
c·f this Paragraph 9.
(t) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that should this Security instrument and the Note not
be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 8 MONTHS from the date
hereof, Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment-in-full ol` all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary dated
subsequent to 8 IVIONTHS from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security Instrument
and the Note, shall be deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this option may not be exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is
solely due to Lender's failure to remit a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary.
10. No Deficiency Judgments. Borrower shall have no personal liability for payment of the debt
secured by this Security Instrument. Lender may enforce the debt only through sale of the Property.

immediate payment-in-full. Foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary attorney's fees and
expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding shall be added to the principal
balance. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations that lt
secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required immediate payment-in—fuII. However,
Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the

jeopardized under state law (including but not limited to situations where the amount secured
by the Security instrument equals or exceeds the maximum principal amount stated or the
maximum period under which loan advances retain the same lien priority initially granted to
loan advances has expired) and state law permits the original lien status to be maintained for
future loan advances through the execution and recordation of one or more documents, then
Lender shall obtain title evidence at Borrower‘s expense. lf the title evidence indicates that the
property is not ewcumbered by any liens (except this Security Instrument, the Second Security
lrrstrument described in Paragraph 13(a) and any subordinate liens that the Lender
determines will also be subordinate to any future loan advances), Lender shall request the
Borrower to execute any documents necessary to protect the lien status of future loan
advances. Borrc·wer agrees to execute such documents. If state law does not permit the

the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends
against enforcerrrent of the lien in, legal proceedings which in the Lender's opinion operate to
prevent the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the Property; or (c) secures
from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordlnating the lien to all
amounts secured by this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the
Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender
may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one
more of the actions set forth above within 10 days of the giving of notice.

severable.

revenues and hereby directs each tenant of the Property to pay the re·its to Lender or Lenders
agents. However, prior to Lender’s notice to Borrower of Borrowers breach of any covenant or
agreement in the Security Instrument, Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues of
the Property as trustee for the benefit of Lender and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes;
an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.
lf Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by
Borrower as trustee for benent of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by this Security
instrument; (b) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all of the rents ol the Property; and (c)
each tenant of the Property shall pay all rents due and unpaid to Lender or Lender’s agent on
Lenders written demand to the tenant.
Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perform any
act that would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Paragraph 19.
Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after
giving notice of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at
any time there is a breach. Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate
any other right or remedy of Lender. This assignment of rents of the Property shall terminate when
the debt secured by this Security llnstrument is paid in full.
20. Foreclosure Procedure. lf Lender requires immediate payment in lull under Paragraph 9,
Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this
Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and any other
remedies provided by applicable law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses
incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Paragraph 20, including, but not limited
to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of title evidence.
lf Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall give written notice to Trustee of the
occurrence of an event of default and of Lender’s election to cause the Property to be sold.
Trustee and Lender shall take such action regarding notice of sale and shall give such
notices to Borrower and to other persons as Applicable Law may require. After the time
required by Applicable Law and after publication of the notice of sale, Trustee, without
demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the
time and place and uinder the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels
and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of the Property for a period
or periods permitted by Applicable Law by public announcement at the time and place fixed

facie evidence of the truth ofthe statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds
of the sale in the following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited
to, reasonable Trustee’s and attorneys’ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to it or to the clerk of
the superior court o1‘ the county in which the sale took place.
21. Lien Priority. The full amount secured by this Security Instrument shall have the same priority over
any other liens on the Property as if the full amount had been disbursed on the date the initial
disbursement was made, regardless of the actual date of any disbursement. The amount secured
by this Security Instrument shall include all direct payments by Lender to Borrower and all other
loan advances permitted by this Security Instrument for any purpose. This lien priority shall apply
notwithstanding any State ·:onstilution, law or regulation, except that this lien priority shall not affect
the priority of any liens; for unpaid State or local governmental unit special assessments or taxes.
22. Adjustable Rate Feature. Under the Note, the initial stated interest rate of 4.01% which accrues on
the principal balance ("lnitiaI Interest Rate”) is subject to change, as described below. When the
interest rate changes, the new adjusted interest rate will be applied to the total outstanding principal
balance. Each adjustment to the interest rate will be based upon the weekly average yield on
United States Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year, as made
available by the Federal Reserve Board in Statistical Release H.15 (519) ("lndex") plus a
margin. lf the index is no longer available, Lender will use as a new Index any Index prescribed by
the Secretary. Lender will give Borrower notice of the new Index.
Lender will perform the calculations described below to determine the new adjusted interest rate,.
The interest rate may change on the tirst day of September 2008, and on [] that day of each
succeeding year [X] the nrst day of each succeeding month ("Change Date") until the loan is paid in
full.
The value of the Index will be detennined, using the most recent Index ligure available thirty (30)
days before the Change Date (“Current Index"). Before each Change Date, the new interest rate will
be calculated by adding a margin to the Current Index. The sum of the margin plus the Current
Index will be called the "CaIcuIated Interest Rate" for each Change Date. The Calculated Interest
Rate will be compared to the interest rate in affect immediately prior to the Change Date (the
"Existing Interest Rate’ ).
[] Annually Adjusting Variable Rate Feature The Calculated Interest Rate cannot be more than
2.0% higher or lower than the Existing Interest Rate, nor can it be more than 5.0% higher or lower
than the Initial Interest Rate.
[X] Monthly Adjusting Variable Rate Feature The Calculated Interest Rate will never increase
above Fourteen and (l1I100's percent (14.01%).
The Calculated Interest; Rate will be adjusted if necessary to comply with these rate Iimitation(s) and
will be in affect until the next Change Date. At any Change Date, if the Calculated Interest Rate
equals the Existing Interest Rate, the interest rate will not change.
23. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall
request Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes
evidencing debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property

without warranty to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or persons shall pay any
recordation costs and the 'l'rustee‘s fee for preparing the reconveyance.
24. Substitute Trustee. In accordance with Applicable Law, Lender may from time to time appoint aa
successor trustee to any Trustee appointed hereunder who has ceased to act. Without conveyance
