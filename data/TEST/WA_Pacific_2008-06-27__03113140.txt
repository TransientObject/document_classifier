hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the
work has been completed to l,ender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken
promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of
progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law

interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower

applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any,
paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied inthe order provided for in Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle a.ny available insurance

paid in connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for
repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may
disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as
the work is completed, lf the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the

9. Protection of Lender‘s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If
(a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is
a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lez1der's interest inthe Property and/or rights under this
Security instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for
enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or
regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is
reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security
Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value ofthe Property, and securing and/or repairing the
Property. Len·;ier's actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which
has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys' fees to
protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position
in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to
make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate
building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although
Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or
obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized
under this Section 9.
Any zunounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower
secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of
disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting
a ment.
p Y lf this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of thc
lease. if Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless
Lender a rees to the merger in writing.
lg. Mortgage Insurance. lf Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan,
Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. lf, for any reason,
the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that
previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separate-ly designated payments
toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage
substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to
the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer
selected by Lender. lf substantrally equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall
continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the
insurance coverage ceased to he in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a
non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable,
notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay
Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments
if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an
insurer selected hy Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated
payments toward the prcmiurts for Mortgage Insurance. lf Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a
condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the
premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage
nsurance i11 effect, or to provide a nonrefundable loss reserve, until Lender‘s requirement for Mortgage
Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such
tcmtination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this rection IO affects
Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it
may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage
Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in l`orce from time to time, and may
enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements
are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the otncr party (or patties) to
these agreements. 'l`hcse agreernents may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of
funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage
Insurance premiums).
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of tl1e Note, another insurer, any reinsurer,
any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that
derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrowers payments for Mortgage insurance, in
exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurers risk, or reducing losses. lf such agreement

is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior
written consent. Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
lnstruinent. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by
Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall
provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15
within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. lf Borrower fails to pay these
sums prior to tI1e expiration ol this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security

Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (ic) pays
all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security nstrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable

Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security
Instrument, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security lnsrrument, shall continue
unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of
the following fonns, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check,

the Note (together with this Sc-curity Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to

individual litigant or thc member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this
Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by
reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such
notice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the
other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. lf Applicable
Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be
deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure
given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice ol` acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to
Section   shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this
Section .

each tenant of the Property shall pay the Rents to Lender or Lender's agents. However,
Borrower shall receive the Rents until: li) Lender has given Borrower notice of default
pursuant to Section 22 of the Security Instrument, and liil Lender has given notice to the
tenantls) that the Rents are to be paid to Lender or Lender's agent. This assignment of Rents
constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.
lf Lender gives notice of default to Borrower: (i) all Rents received by Borrower shall be
held by Borrower as trustee for the benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured
by the Security Instrument; (ii) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all of the Rents
of the Property; (iiil Borrower agrees that each tenant of the Property shall pay all Rents due
and unpaid to Lender or Lender's agents upon Lender's written demand to 1:he tenant; liv)

collecting the Rents, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, receiveds fees, premiums
on receiver`s bonds, repair and maintenance costs, insurance premiums, taxes, assessments
and other charges on the Property, and then to the sums secured by the Security Instrument;
(v) Lender, Lender's agents or any judicially appointed receiver shall be liable to account for
only those Rents actually received; and (vi) Lender shall be entitled to have a receiver
appointed to take possession of and manage the Property and collect the Rents and profits
derived from the Property without any showing as to the inadequacy of the Property as
security.
lf the Rents of the Property are not sufficient to cover the costs of taining control of and
managing the Property and of collecting the Rents any funds expended by Lender for such
purposes shall become indebtedness of Borrower to Lender secured by the Security
Instrument pursuant to Section 9.
Borrower represents and warrants: that Borrower has not executed any prior assignment
of the Rents and has not performed, and will not perform, any act that would prevent Lender
from exercising its rights under this paragraph.
Lender, or Lender's agents or a judicially appointed receiver, shall not be required to enter
upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after giving notice of default to
Borrower. However, Lender, or Lender's agents or a judicially appointed receiver, may do so
at any time when a default occurs. Any application of Rents shall not cure or waive any
default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender. This assignment of Rents of the
Property shall terminate when all the sums secured by the Security Instrument are paid in full.
I. CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISION. Borrower's default or breach under any note or
agreement in which Lender has an interest shall be a breach under the Security Instrument
and Lender may invoke any of the remedies permitted by the Security Instrument.
