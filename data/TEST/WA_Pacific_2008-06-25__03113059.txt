duty or obligation to do so. It ;is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions
authorized under this Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower
secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date ol`
disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting
payment.

10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan,
Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason,
the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that
previously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments
toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage
substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to
the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer
selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall
continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance
coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss
reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact
that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or
earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance
coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender
again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the
premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the
Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage
Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide
a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender's requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with
any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is
required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section I0 aflects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the
rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may
incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may
enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, o·r reduce losses. These agreements
are on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to
these agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source
of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage
Insurance premiums).
As a result of these agreeme·nts, Lender, any purchaser of the Note. another insurer, any reinsurer,
any other entity, or any affiliate ofany of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that
derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in

exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement
provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer‘s risk in exchange for a share of the premiums
paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed "captive reinsurance." Further:
(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for
Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount
Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has — if any - with respect to the
Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of l998 or any other law. These rights may
include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage
Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any
Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.
11. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.
lf the Property is damaged. such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of
the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and I.ender's security is not lessened,
During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds
until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to
Lender's satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the
repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed.
Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous
Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous
Proceeds. Ii` the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened,
the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not
then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the
order provided for in Section 2.
In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the X/liscellaneous Proceeds
shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess,
if any, paid to Borrower.
ln the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market
value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater
than the amount of the sums securred by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking,
destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by
this Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the
following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking,
destruction. or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the
partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market
value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the
amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless
Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.
If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if , after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing
Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails
to respond to Lender within 30 da_ys after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and

apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by
this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes
Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to
Miscellaneous Proceeds.
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding. whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in
Lender's judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender’s
interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if
acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding; to be
dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender‘s judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material
impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights trnder this Security Instrument. The proceeds of
any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender‘s interest in the Property
are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied
in the order provided for in Section 2.
12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instru ment granted by Lender
to Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower
or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against
any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify
amortization of the sums secured lby this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original
Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any l`orbearance by Lender in exercising any right or
remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or
Successors iu Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or
preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
13. joint and Several Lialbility; C0—signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants
and agrees that Borrower's obligations and liability shall bejoint and several. However, any Borrower who
co—signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co—signer"): (a) is co—signing this Security
Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co—signer’s interest in the Property under the terms of this
Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and
(c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, l`orbear or make any
accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the co—signer’s
consent.
Subject to the provisions of Election 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower‘s
obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved hy Lender, shall obtain all of
Borrower‘s rights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from
Borrower‘s obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in
writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section
20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with
Borrower‘s default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this
Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorrreys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees.
In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific
fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge
fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.

lf the Loan is subject to a Ilaw which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted
so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the
permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce tl1e
charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted
limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed
under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will
be treated as a partial prepa_yment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is
provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to
Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument
must be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to
have been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice
address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless
Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless
Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify
Lender of Borrower's change of address. lf Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change
of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may
be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender
shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's address stated herein unless
Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security
I nstrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. lf any notice
required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law. the Applicable Law requirement
will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be
governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and
obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of
Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it
might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In
the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law,
such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given
effect without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include
corresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b] words in the singular shall mean and
include the plural and vice versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take
any action.
17. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,
"lnterest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited
to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or
escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower
is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender`s prior
written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security

Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by
Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall
provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15
within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower l`ails to pay these
sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security
Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower,
19. Borrower's Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions,
Borrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security lnstru ment discontinued at any time prior
to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to any power of sale contained in this
Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Bo1rower's
right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that
Borrower: (zi) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note
as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all
expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys'
fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting l.,ender's
interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may
reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest in the Propert_y and rights under this Security Instrument,
and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged.
Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following
forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check
or cashier`s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a
federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by
Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no
acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under
Section l8.
20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest
in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to
Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects Periodic
Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing
obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more
changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. lf there is a change of the Loan Servicer,
Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan
Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in
connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by
a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower
will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicerand are not assumed by
the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an
individual litigant or the member ofa class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security
Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of . or any duty owed by reason of,
this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given
in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach .and afforded the other party hereto
a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Appiicable Law provides a

time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be
reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to
Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall
be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.
21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those
substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the
following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and
herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b)

sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous
Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of
the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit
or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental
Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any
Hazardous Substance, and (ct any condition caused by the presence, use or release ofa Hazardous Substance
which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental
or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous
Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions
in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an
Environmental Cleanup.
NON-UNIFORM COVEINANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following
Borrower‘s breach of any cove-nant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to

the notice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the

this Security Instrument and sale of the Property at public auction at a date not less than 120 days in
the future. The notice shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration, the
right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower
to acceleration and sale, and any other matters required to be included in the notice by Applicable Law.
If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option, may require
immediate payment in fiill of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and
