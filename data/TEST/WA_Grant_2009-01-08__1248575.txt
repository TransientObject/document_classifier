TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements, .
appurtenances and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be
covered by this Security Instrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the
i "Property." Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by
r Borrower in this Security Instrument; but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS, (as nominee for
i Lender and Lender's successors and assigns), has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including,
but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender
including, but not limited to, releasing or canceling this Security Instrument.
BORROWER COVENANT S that Borrower is lawfully seized of the estate hereby conveyed and has the
right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of
record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands,
subject to any encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform I
covenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real
property.
Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
UNIFORM COVENANTS.
1. Payment of Principal, Interest and Late Charge. Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and
interest on, the debt evidenced bythe Note and late charges due under the Note.
Z. Monthly Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. Borrower shall include in each monthly
payment, together with the principal and interest as set forth in the Note and any late charges, a sum for (a)
taxes and special assessments levied or to be levied against the Property, (b) leasehold payments or ground
rents on the Property, and (c) premiums for insurance required under paragraph 4. In any year in which the
Lender must pay a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
("Secretary"), or in any year in which such premium would have been required if Lender still held the Security

Instrument, each monthly payment shall also include either: (i) a sum for the annual mortgage insurance
premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary, or (ii) a monthly charge instead of a mortgage insurance
premium if this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary, in a reasonable amount to be detennined by the
Secretary. Except for the monthly charge by the Secretary, these items are called "Escrow Items" and the sums
paid to Lender are called "Escrow Funds.”
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that may be required for Borrower's escrow account under the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. Section 2601 et seq. and implementing regulations, 24 CFR
Part 3500, as they may be amended from time to time ("RESPA"), except that the cushion or reserve
permitted by RESPA for unanticipated disbursements or disbursements before the Borrower's payments are
available in the account may not be based on amounts due for the mortgage insurance premium.
If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Items exceed the amounts permitted to be held by RESPA,
Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. If the amounts of funds held by
Lender at any time are not sufficient to pay the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify the Borrower and
require Borrower to make up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.
The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If
Borrower tenders to Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower's account shall be credited with the
balance remaining for all installment items (a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage insurance premium installment .
that Lender has not become obligated to pay to the Secretary, and Lender shall promptly refund any excess t
funds to Borrower. Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of the Property or its acquisition by Lender, l
Borrower's account shall be credited with any balance remaining for all installments for items (a), (b), and (c).
3. Application of Payments. All payments under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied by Lender as
follows:
First, to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly charge
by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance premium;
Second, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood and other
hazard insurance premiums, as required;
Third to interest due under the Note;
Fourth to amortization of the principal of the Note; and
Fifth, to late charges due under the Note.
4. Fire, Flood and Other Hazard Insurance. Borrower shall insure all improvements on the Property,
l whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against any hazards, casualties, and contingencies,
l including fire, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for
the periods that Lender requires. Borrower shall also insure all improvements on the Property, whether now in
existence or subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent required by the Secretary. All insurance
shall be carried with companies approved by Lender. The insurance policies and any renewals shall be held by
Lender and shall include loss payable clauses in favor of and in a form acceptable to, Lender.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof of
loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Each insurance company concemed is hereby authorized and directed
to make payment for such loss directly to Lender, instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly. All or any
part of the insurance proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either (a) to the reduction of the
indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order
in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal, or (b) to the restoration or repair of the damaged
Property. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the
monthly payments which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess
insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this
Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
In the event of foreclosure of this Security Instrument or other transfer of title to the Property that
extinguishes the indebtedness, all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to insurance policies in force shall
pass to the purchaser.
5. Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Borrower's Loan
Application; Leaseholds. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal
residence within sixty days after the execution of this Security Instrument (or within sixty days of a later sale
or transfer of the Property) and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at
least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that requirement will cause undue
hardship for Borrower, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.
Borrower shall notify Lender of any extenuating circumstances. Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy,
damage or substantially change the Property or allow the Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear

excepted. Lender may inspect the Property if the Property is vacant or abandoned or the loan is in default.
Lender may take reasonable action to protect and preserve such vacant or abandoned Property. Borrower shall
also be in default if Borrower, during the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate
infomation or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with any material information) in connection
with the loan evidenced by the Note, including, but not limited to, representations conceming Borrower's
occupancy of the Property as a principal residence. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower
shall comply with the provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and ,
fee title shall not be merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing. f
6. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in i
connection with any condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in place of I
condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender to the extent of the full amount of the i
indebtedness that remains unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument. Lender shall apply such
proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any
delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal. Any
application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments,
which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess proceeds over an
amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be paid
to the entity legally entitled thereto.
7. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender's Rights in the Property. Borrower shall pay all
govemmental or municipal charges, fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2. Borrower shall
pay these obligations on time directly to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure to pay would
adversely affect Lender's interest in the Property, upon Lender's request Borrower shall promptly fumish to
Lender receipts evidencing these payments.
If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to perform
any other covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that
may significantly affect Lender's rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, for condemnation
i or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of
, the Property and Lender's rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard insurance and other items
i mentioned in paragraph 2.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of Borrower and
be secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement, at the
Note rate, and at the option of Lender, shall be immediately due and payable.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a mamier acceptable to
Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings
which in the Lender's opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien; or (c) secures from the holder of
the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. lf Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security
Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one
or more of the actions set forth above within 10 days of the giving of notice.
8. Fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.
(a) Default. Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary, in the case of
payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security
Instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or
(ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations
contained in this Security Instrument.

I||||I||IIII|||||IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII||I||||I||||I|I|||II|

(b) Sale Without Credit Approval. Lender shall, if pennitted by applicable law (including Section
341(d) of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C. 1701j-3(d)) and with
the prior approval of the Secretary, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this
Security Instrument if:
(i) All or part of the Property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the Property,
is sold or otherwise transferred (other than by devise or descent), and
(ii) The Property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal residence, or
the purchaser or grantee does so occupy the Property but his or her credit has not been approved in
accordance with the requirements of the Secretary.
(c) No Waiver. If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require immediate payment in full,
but Lender does not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights with respect to
subsequent events.
(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary. In many circumstances regulations issued by the Secretary will
limit Lender's rights, in the case of payment defaults, to require immediate payment in full and .
foreclose if not paid. This Security Instrument does not authorize acceleration or foreclosure if not
permitted by regulations of the Secretary. N
(e) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that if this Security Instrument and the Note are not
determined to be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 60 days from the date p
hereof Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary dated subsequent to I
60 days Hom the date hereof declining to insure this Security Instrument and the Note, shall be 1
deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option may not be
exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is solely due to Lender's failure to remit a
mortgage insurance premium tothe Secretary.
10. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate payment in
full because of Borrower's failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This right
applies even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower shall
tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower's account current including, to the extent they
are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary
attomeys' fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by
Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had
not required immediate payment in full. However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender
( has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately
  preceding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding, (ii) reinstatement will preclude foreclosure
i on different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of the lien created by
this Security Instrument.
11. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time of payment
or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to any
successor in interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original Borrower or
Borrower's successor in interest. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any successor
in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this
Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower's successors in
interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the
exercise of any right or remedy.
12. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-Signers. The covenants and
agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and
Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(b). Borrower's covenants and agreements shall be joint and
several. Any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note: (a) is co-signing
this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower's interest in the Property under the
tenns of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make
any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower's
consent.

14. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be governed by Federal law and the
law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this
Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of
this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision. To this end
the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.
15. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this Security
Instrument.
16. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or
release of any Hazardous Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to

sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous
Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the
I Property.
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other
action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous
I Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge. If Borrower learns, or is notified
r by any governmental or regulatory authority, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous
  Substances affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in
l accordance with Environmental Law.
As used in this paragraph 16, "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous
substances by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic
petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or
formaldehyde, and radioactive materials. As used in this paragraph 16, "Enviromnental Law" means federal
laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental
protection.
l
NON-UNIFORM COVENANT S. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows: H
17. Assignment of Rents. Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents and I
revenues of the Property. Borrower authorizes Lender or Lender's agents to collect the rents and revenues and
hereby directs each tenant of the Property to pay the rents to Lender or Lender's agents. However, prior to  
Lender's notice to Borrower of Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in the Security Instrument, I
Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues of the Property as trustee for the benefit of Lender l
and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for I
additional security only. I
If Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by -
Borrower as trustee for benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument;
(b) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all of the rents of the Property; and (c) each tenant of the
Property shall pay all rents due and unpaid to Lender or Lender's agent on Lender's written demand to the
tenant.
Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perfomr any act that
would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this paragraph 17.
Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after giving
notice of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at any time there
is a breach. Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate any other right or
remedy of Lender. This assignment of rents of the Property shall terminate when the debt secured by the
Security Instrument is paid in full.

18. Foreclosure Procedure. If Lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9,
Lender may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law. Lender shall
be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph 18,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall give written notice to Trustee of the occurrence of
an event of default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold. Trustee and Lender shall
take such action regarding notice of sale and shall give such notices to Borrower and to other persons as “
applicable law may require. After the time required by applicable law and after publication of the notice  
of sale, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest I
bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels p
and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of the Property for a period or periods i
permitted by applicable law by public announcement at the time and place fixed in the notice of sale. I
Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.
Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee's deed conveying the Property without any covenant
or warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee's deed shall be prima facie evidence of the
truth of the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order:
(a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys' fees; (b) I
to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally
entitled to it or to the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the sale took place.
If the Lender's interest in this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary and the Secretary
requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9, the Secretary may invoke the nonjudicial power
of sale provided in the Single Family Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1994 ("Act") (12 U.S.C. 3751 et seq.)
by requesting a foreclosure commissioner designated under the Act to commence foreclosure and to sell
the Property as provided in the Act. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall deprive the Secretary of any
rights otherwise available to a Lender under this paragraph 18 or applicable law.
y 19. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request
p Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt
  secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty and
p without charge to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or persons shall pay any recordation
n costs.
20. Substitute Trustee. In accordance with applicable law, Lender may from time to time appoint a
  successor trustee to any Trustee appointed hereunder who has ceased to act. Without conveyance of the
  Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title, power and duties conferred upon Trustee herein
t and by applicable law.
21. Use of Property. The Property is not used principally for agricultural or farming purposes.
22. Riders to this Security Instrument. If one or more riders are executed by Borrower and recorded
together with this Security Instrument, the covenants of each such rider shall be incorporated into and shall
amend and supplement the covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument as if the rider(s) were a part
of this Security Instrument. [Check applicable box(es)].
