between Grantor and Grantee dated as of 07/20/2009 (the “Purchase Agreement"), this
Declaration of Lien Rights is made by the undersigned against certain property located in Kitsap

Grantor has agreed that the Property shall be used as Grantofs primary residence for one
calendar year immediately following the date of recording of the deed conveying the Property to
Grantor (the "Occupancy Milestone"). Grantor has also agreed that if Grantor does not use the
property as Grantor’s primary residence until the Occupancy Milestone, then Grantee shall have a
valid and perfected lien upon the Property in an amount equal to: (i) in the case of a sale or other
transfer of fee title to the Property, the amount of the appreciation of the Property since the date on
which Grantor acquired title to the Property, or (ii) in the case of a lease or other occupancy
agreement (a "Lease"), the greater of: (a) the actual rent or economic consideration, or (b) fair
market rental value of the Property (in either case, "Rent") payable to or for the benetit of Grantor
during the term of the Lease. For purposes of these provisions, the term "appreciation" shall mean

200908250204 08/25/2009 11:29:07 AIVI Page 2 of 4
” the difference between (i) the fair market value ofthe Property at the time of Grantor’s transfer
thereof, less customary costs of such transfer, and the consideration paid by Grantor to Grantee to
acquire the Property. The foregoing amounts are collectively referred to herein as the "Community
Preservation Lien", which in no case shall be less than $25,000.00. The Community Preservation
Lien shall be inchoate upon recording of this Declaration of Lien Rights.
lf Grantor does not occupy the Property as Grantor’s primary residence until the
Occupancy Milestone, the Community Preservation Lien shall be automatically executing,
automatically perfected, and relate back to the recording of this Declaration of Lien Rights upon the
earlier of: (i) one day prior to a transfer of any legal or benehcial interest in or to the Property from
Grantor to any other person or entity except any transfer by Grantor: (a) to a family trust controlled
by the Grantor; (b) made by Grantor’s estate, surviving spouse or child upon the death of any
Grantor; (c) of a security interest granted to a licensed and regulated institutional lender pursuant
to a deed of trust or upon foreclosure of such security interest; (d) where the spouse of Grantor
becomes the only co—owner of the Property; (e) relating to a decree of dissolution of marriage or
legal separation, or properly settlement agreement relating thereto; (f) necessary to accommodate
a job transfer required by Grantor’s employer (not including Grantor if Grantor is self-employed); (g)
necessitated by a medical or financial emergency, proof of which has been delivered to Grantee
and has been approved by Grantee in its reasonable discretion, or (h) necessitated by another
"hardship” situation, proof of which has been delivered to Grantee and has been approved by
Grantee in its reasonable discretion, or (ii) the date on which Grantor ceases to use the Property as ,
Grantor’s primary residence. I
This Declaration of Lien Rights and the Community Preservation Lien shall at all times be
and remain subordinate to any security interest granted by Grantorto any licensed and regulated
institutional lender in connection with the purchase of the Property, and to any rennance ofthe
| obligation secured by such security interest. The Community Preservation Lien may be foreclosed
’ by Grantee in the same manner as foreclosure of a deed of trust pursuant to Revised Code of
’ Washington Title 61, Chapter 24. Grantee shall be entitled to collect all reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs incurred by Grantee in enforcing and foreclosing this Lien.
Should the Grantor continuously use the Property as the Grantor’s primary residence until
expiration of the Occupancy Milestone, upon such expiration this Declaration of Lien Rights and
Community Preservation Lien shall automatically terminate and be released.
