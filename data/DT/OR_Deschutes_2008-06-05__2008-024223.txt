TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements, appurtenances and fixtures
now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be covered by this Security Instrument. All of the
foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the "Property. " Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal
title to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee
for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to,
the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing and
canceling this Security Instrument.
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seized ofthe estate hereby conveyed and has the right to grant and convey
the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally
the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRIHVIENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants with limited
variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property.
Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
UNIFORM COVENANTS.
1. Payment of Principal, Interest and Late Charge. Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt
evidenced by the Note and late charges due under the Note.
2. Monthly Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. Borrower shall include in each monthly payment, together
with the principal and interest as set forth in the Note and any late charges, a sum for (a) taxes and special assessments levied or to
be levied against the Property, (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, and (c) premiums for insurance required under
paragraph 4. In any year in which the Lender must pay a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development ("Secreta1y"), or in any year in which such premium would have been required if Lender still held the Security
Instrument, each monthly payment shall also include either: (i) a sum for the annual mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender
to the Secretary, or (ii) a monthly charge instead of a mortgage insurance premium if this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary,
in a reasonable amount to be determined by the Secretary. Except for the monthly charge by the Secretary, these items are called
"Escrow Items" and the sums paid to Lender are called "Escrow Funds."
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to exceed the maximum amount
that may be required for Borrower’s escrow account under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, I2 U. S. C. Section 2601
et seq. and implementing regulations, 24 CFR Part 3500, as they may be amended from time to time (‘ ‘RESPA’ ’), except that the
cushion or reserve permitted by RESPA for unanticipated disbursements or disbursements before the Borrower’s payments are
available in the account may not be based on amounts due for the mortgage insurance premium.
If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Items exceed the amounts permitted to be held by RESPA, Lender shall account to
Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. lf the amounts of funds held by Lender at any time are not sufficient to pay
the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify the Borrower and require Borrower to make up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.
The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower tenders to
Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower’s account shall be credited with the balance remaining for all installment items
(a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage insurance premium installment that Lender has not become obligated to pay to the Secretary,
and Lender shall promptly refund any excess funds to Borrower. Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of the Property or its
acquisition by Lender, Borrower’s account shall be credited with any balance remaining for all installments for items (a), (b), and
(c).
3. Application of Payments. All payments under paragraphs l and 2 shall be applied by Lender as follows:
Fg to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly charge by the Secretary instead
of the monthly mortgage insurance premium,
Second, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood and other hazard insurance
premiums, as required,
Third, to interest due under the Note;
Fourth, to amortization of the principal of the Note, and
_l*@, to late charges due under the Note.
4. Fire, Flood and Other Hazard Insurance. Borrower shall insure all improvements on the Property, whether now in
existence or subsequently erected, against any hazards, casualties, and contingencies, including fire, for which Lender requires
insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for the periods that Lender requires. Borrower shall also insure
all improvements on the Property, whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent required by
the Secretary. All insurance shall be carried with companies approved by Lender. The insurance policies and any renewals shall be
held by Lender and shall include loss payable clauses in favor of, and in a form acceptable to, Lender.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly
by Borrower. Each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and directed to make payment for such loss directly to Lender,
instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly. All or any part ofthe insurance proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either
(a) to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the
order in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal, or (b) to the restoration or repair ofthe damaged Property. Any application
of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments which are referred to in paragraph
2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness
under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
In the event of foreclosure of this Security Instrument or other transfer of title to the Property that extinguishes the indebtedness,
all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to insurance policies in force shall pass to the purchaser.
5. Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Borr0wer’s Loan Application; Leaseholds.
Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower’ s principal residence within sixty days after the execution of this
Security Instmment (or within sixty days of a later sale or transfer of the Property) and shall continue to occupy the Property as
Borrower’s principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that requirement will cause
undue hardship for Borrower, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower’s control. Borrower shall notify
Lender of any extenuating circumstances. Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy, damage or substantially change the Property
or allow the Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Lender may inspect the Property if the Prope ` v nt or

abandoned or the loan is in default. Lender may take reasonable action to protect and preserve such vacant or abandoned Property.
Borrower shall also be in default if Borrower, during the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate information
or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with any material information) in connection with the loan evidenced by the Note,
including, but not limited to, representations concerning Borrower’ s occupancy ofthe Property as a principal residence. If this Security
Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with the provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, _
the leasehold and fee title shall not be merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
6. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in connection with any
condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in place of condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall
be paid to Lender to the extent ofthe full amount ofthe indebtedness that remains unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument.
Lender shall apply such proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any
delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in paragraph 3 , and then to prepayment of principal. Any application ofthe proceeds
to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments, which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change
the amount of such payments. Any excess proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and
this Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
7. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender’s Rights in the Property. Borrower shall pay all governmental or
municipal charges, fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2. Borrower shall pay these obligations on time directly
to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure to pay would adversely affect Lender’ s interest in the Property, upon Lender ’ s request
Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing these payments.
If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to perform any other covenants and
agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that may significantly affect Lender’s rights in the
Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, for condemnation or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay
whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and Lender’s rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard
insurance and other items mentioned in paragraph 2.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of Borrower and be secured by this
Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement, at the Note rate, and at the option of Lender,
shall be immediately due and payable.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (a) agrees in writing
to the payment ofthe obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends
against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in the Lender’s opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien,
or (c) secures from the holder ofthe lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If
Lender determines that any part ofthe Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender
may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more ofthe actions set forth above within
10 days of the giving of notice.
8. Fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.
(a) Default. Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary, in the case of payment defaults, require
immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security Instrument prior to or
on the due date of the next monthly payment, or
(ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations contained in this Security
Instrument.
(b) Sale Without Credit Approval. Lender shall, if permitted by applicable law (including Section 341(d) of the Garn-
St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U. S.C. 170 lj-3 (d)) and with the prior approval ofthe Secretary, require
immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) All or part ofthe Property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the Property, is sold or otherwise
transferred (other than by devise or descent), and
(ii) The Property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal residence, or the purchaser or grantee
does so occupy the Property but his or her credit has not been approved in accordance with the requirements of the
Secretary.
(c) No Waiver. If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require immediate payment in full, but Lender does
not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights with respect to subsequent events.
(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary. In many circumstances regulations issued by the Secretary will limit Lender’ s rights,
in the case of payment defaults, to require immediate payment in full and foreclose if not paid. This Security Instrument
does not authorize acceleration or foreclosure if not permitted by regulations of the Secretary.
(e) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that if this Security Instrument and the Note are not determined to be eligible
for insurance under the National Housing Act within 60 days from the date hereof, Lender may, at its option, require
immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of
the Secretary dated subsequent to 60 days from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security Instrument and the Note,
shall be deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option may not be exercised by
Lender when the unavailability of insurance is solely due to Lender’s failure to remit a mortgage insurance premium to the
Secretary.
10. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated ifLender has required immediate payment in full because of Borrower’ s
failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This right applies even after foreclosure proceedings are
instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower shall tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower’ s account
current including, to the extent they are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and
customary attorneys’ fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this
Security Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required immediate payment in full.
However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of
foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately preceding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding, (ii)
reinstatement will preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of
the lien created by this Security Instrument.
11. Borrower Not Released; Forbearanee By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time of payment or modification of
amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to any successor in interest of Borrower shall not
operate to release the liability ofthe original Borrower or Borrower’s successor in interest. Lender shall not be required to commence
proceedings against any successor in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modiiy amortization ofthe sums secured
by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower’s successors in interest. Any
forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
12. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-Signers. The covenants and agreements of this Security
Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower, subject to the provisions of p%Zgrap§ §(b).

execute the Note: (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower’ s interest in the Property
under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and
(c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to
the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower’s consent.
13. Notices. Any notice to Borrower provided for in this Security Instrument shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by
first class mail unless applicable law requires use of another method. The notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other
address Borrower designates by notice to Lender. Any notice to Lender shall be given by first class mail to Lender’s address stated
herein or any address Lender designates by notice to Borrower. Any notice provided for in this Security Instrument shall be deemed
to have been given to Borrower or Lender when given as provided in this paragraph.
14. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instnrment shall be governed by Federal law and the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with
applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without
the conflicting provision. To this end the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.
15. Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
16. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous
Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property that is in violation
of any Environmental Law. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small
quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance
of the Property.
Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action by any
governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of
which Borrower has actual knowledge. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, that any removal
or other remediation of any Hazardous Substances affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary
remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law.
As used in this paragraph 16, "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances by
Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides
and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials. As used in this paragraph
16, "Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety
or environmental protection.
NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
17. Assignment of Rents. Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents and revenues of the Property.
Borrower authorizes Lender or Lender’s agents to collect the rents and revenues and hereby directs each tenant of the Property to
pay the rents to Lender or Lender’s agents. However, prior to Lender’s notice to Borrower of Borrower’s breach of any covenant or
agreement in the Security Instrument, Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues ofthe Property as trustee for the benefit
of Lender and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security
only.
If Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by Borrower as trustee for benefit
of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument; (b) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all
of the rents of the Property; and (c) each tenant of the Property shall pay all rents due and unpaid to Lender or Lender’s agent on
Lender’s written demand to the tenant.
Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perform any act that would prevent Lender
from exercising its rights under this paragraph 17.
Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after giving notice of breach to
Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at any time there is a breach. Any application of rents shall
not cure or waive any default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender. This assignment of rents ofthe Property shall terminate
when the debt secured by the Security Instrument is paid in full.
18. Foreclosure Procedure. If Lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9, Lender may invoke the
power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred
in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph 18, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of
title evidence.
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written notice of the occurrence
of an event of default and of Lender’s election to cause the Property to be sold and shall cause such notice to be recorded in
each county in which any part of the Property is located. Lender or Trustee shall give notice of sale in the manner prescribed
by applicable law to Borrower and to other persons prescribed by applicable law. After the time required by applicable law,
Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place
and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may
postpone sale of all or any parcel of the Property by public announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled
sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.
Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee’s deed conveyingthe Property without any covenant or warranty, expressed
or implied. The recitals in the Trustee’s deed shall be prima facie evidence of the truth ofthe statements made therein. Trustee
shall apply the proceeds ofthe sale in the following order: (a) to all expenses ofthe sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable
Trustee’s and attorneys’ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons
legally entitled to it.
If the Lender’s interest in this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary and the Secretary requires immediate payment
in full under Paragraph 9, the Secretary may invoke the nonjudicial power of sale provided in the Single Family Mortgage
Foreclosure Act of 1994 ("Act") (12 U.S.C. 3751 et seq.) by requesting a foreclosure commissioner designated under the Act
to commence foreclosure and to sell the Property as provided in the Act. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall deprive the
Secretary of any rights otherwise available to a Lender under this Paragraph 18 or applicable law.
19. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request Trustee to reconvey
the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee.
Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty and without charge to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person
or persons shall pay any recordation costs.
20. Substitute Trustee. Lender may, from time to time, remove Trustee and appoint a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed
hereunder. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor tnrstee shall succeed to all the title, power and duties conferred upon
Trustee herein and by applicable law.
21. Attorneys’ Fees. As used in this Security Instrument and in the Note, "attorneys’ fees" shall include any ttorneys’ fees
awarded by an appellate court.   , E
