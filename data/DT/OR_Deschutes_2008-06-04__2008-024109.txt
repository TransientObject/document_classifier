due under the Note. Borrower shall alsopay funds for Escrow Items pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the
Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S. currency. However, if any check or other instrument received
by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that
any or all subsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more ofthe following
forms, as selected by Lender: la) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer‘s check or cashier's
check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.
Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such other
location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15. Lender may return any
payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender may
accept any payment or partial payment insufncient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or
prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such
payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date,
then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes
payment to bring the Loan current. lf Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either
apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal
balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the
future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument
or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Exceptas otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments accepted
and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the Note; (bl principal
due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the
order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts
due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note.
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a sufficient amount
to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. lf more than
one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the repayment of the
Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after
the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late
charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note shall
not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note,
until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments
and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property; {lc)
leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums forany and all insurance required by Lender
under Section 5; and ld) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of
the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called
"Escrow ltems." Atorigination or atanytime during the term ofthe Loan, Lender may require that Community Association
Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an
Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower
shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower’s obligation to pay the Funds for any or
all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower's obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at anytime.
Any such waiver may only bein writing. ln the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable,
the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires,
shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower’s
obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and
agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "coyenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. lf
Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for
an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be
obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow
Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to
Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds at
the time specified under RESPA, and (bl notto exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender
shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of future
Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.
'l'he Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity
Gncluding Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall
apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower
for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow items, unless Lender
pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is
made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower
any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the
Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting ofthe Funds as required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under FIESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the
excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RES PA, Lender
shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the
shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments. lf there is a deficiency of Funds held
in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by BESPA, and Borrower shall pay to
Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly
ayments.
P Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower any
Funds held by Lender.

at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur if
Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into
agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce Icsses. These agreements are on terms and
conditions that are satisfactory tc the mortgage insurer and the other party (cr parties) to these agreements. These
agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer
may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser ofthe Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or
any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly} amounts that derive from (or might be characterized
as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer’s
risk, or reducing losses. Ifsuch agreement provides that an affiliate cf Lender takes a share ofthe insurer‘s risk in exchange
for a share of the premiums paid tothe insurer, the arrangement is often termed "captive reinsurance." Further:
(a) Any such agreements wlll not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage
Insurance, or any other terms ofthe Loan. Such agreements wlll not Increase the amount Borrower will owe for
Mortgage Insurance, and they wlll not entltle Borrower to any refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the Mortgage
Insurance under the Homeowners Protectlon Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may Include the right to
receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation ofthe Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage
Insurance termlnated autcmatlcally, and/or tc recolve a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premlums that were
unearned at the time of such cancellation or terminatlcm. ML

( to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your contract or loan balance, the interest rate on the
( underlying contract or loan will apply to this added amount. The effective date of coverage may be the date your

THIS FIXED/ADJUSTABLE RATE RIDER is made this zzun day of

supplement the Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the "Security Instrument")
  of the same date given by the undersigned ("Borrower") to secure Borrowers

THE NOTE PROVIDES FOR A CHANGE IN BORROWER'S FIXED INTEREST
RATE TO AN ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE. THE NOTE LIMITS THE
AMOUNT BORROWER’S ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE CAN CHANGE AT
ANY ONE TIME AND THE MAXIMUM RATE BORROWER MUST PAY.
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. In addition to the covenants and agreements made in
the Security Instrument, Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
A. ADJUSTABLE RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES I
The Note provides for an initial fixed interest rate of 5.2:75%. The Note also
provides for a change inthe initial fixed rate to an adjustable interest rate, as follows:
4. ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES
(A)Change Dates
The initial fixed interest rate l will pay will change to an adjustable interest rate on the
1ST day of June, 2013 , and the adjustable interest rate l will pay may
change on that day every 12TH month thereafter. The date on which my initial fixed
interest rate changes to an adjustable interest rate, and each date on which my
adjustable interest rate could change, is called a "Change Date"
(B)The Index
Beginning with the first Change Date, my adjustable interest rate will be based on
an Index. The "lndex" is the average of interbank offered rates for one-year U.S.
dolIar—denominated deposits inthe London market (" LI BOR”), as published in The Wall
Street Journal. The most recent Index figure available as of the date 45 clays before
each Change Date is called the "Current Index."
lf the Index is no longer available, the Note Holder will choose a new index that is
based upon comparable information. The Note Holder will give me notice of this choice.
(C)CalcuIation of Changes
Before each Change Date, the Note Holder will calculate my new interest rate by /
adding 1-wo rum mama-exoumus percentage point(s) ( 2.375% { ) o A =

the Current Index. The Note Holder will then round the result of this addition to the
nearest oneeighth of one percentage point (0.125%). Subject to the limits stated in
Section 4(D) below, this rounded amount will be my new interest rate until the next
Change Date.
The Note Holder will then determine the amount of my monthly payment. For
payment adjustments occurring before the First Principal and Interest Payment Due
l Date, the amount of my monthly payment will be sufficient to repay all accrued interest
each month on the unpaid principal balance at the new interesttete. if 1 makes troiuntary

payment amount for subsequent payments will be reduced te the etttetmt rteeessary
to repay all accrued interest on the red uced pr§rtcipa.l cataracts atthesturrertt interest rate
For payment adjustments occurring on or after the First Principal and Interest Payment (
Due Date, the amount of my monthly payment will be sufficient to repay unpaid principal I
and interest that l am expected to owe in full on the Maturity Date at the current interest
rate in substantially equal payments.
(D)Limits on Interest Rate Changes
The interest rate I am required to pay at thefirst Change Date will not be greater than
10.875% or less than 2 . 375% . Thereafter, my adjustable interest rate will never
be increased or decreased on any single Change Date by more than
mo percentage point(s) ( 2.000% )from the rate
of interest I have been paying for the preceding 12 month(s). My interest rate will
never be greater than 10 . ststr.
(E) Effective Date of Changes
My new interest rate will become effective on each Change Date. I will pay the amount
of my new monthly payment beginning on the first monthly payment date after the
Change Date until the amount of my monthly payment changes again.
(F) Notice of Changes
Before the effective date of any change in my interest rate and/or monthly payment,
the Note Holder will deliver or mail to me a notice of such change. The notice will include
information required by law to be given to me and also the title and telephone number
of a person who will answer any question I may have regarding the notice.
(G) Date of First Principal and Interest Payment
The date of my first payment consisting of both principal and interest on this Note
(the "First Principal and Interest Payment Due Date") shall be that date which is the
10th anniversary date ofthe first payment due date, as reflected in Section 3(A) of the
Note.
B. TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTY OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN BORROWER
1. Until Borrower's initial fixed interest rate changes to an adjustable interest rate I

exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
if Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of
acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the
date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower
must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. lf Borrower fails to pay

remedies permitted by this Security lnstrumentwithoutfurther notice or demand
on Borrower.
2. When Borrowers initial fixed interest rate changes to an adjustable interest rate
under the terms stated in Section A above, Uniform Covenant 18 of the Security
Instrument described in Section B1 above shall then cease to be in effect, and the
provisions of Uniform Covenant 18 of the Security Instrument shall be amended to read
as follows:
Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in
this Section 18, "lnterest in the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest
in the Property, includ ing, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred

I transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in
Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender’s prior written consent, Lender
may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such
exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law. Lender also shall not exercise this
option if; (a) Borrower causes to be submitted to Lender information required by

the transferee; and (b) Lender reasonably determines that Lender’s security will I
not be impaired by the loan assumption and that the risk of a breach of any I
covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument is acceptable to Lender.
To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Lend er may charge a reasonable
fee as a condition to Lender’s consent to the loan assumption. Lend er also may
require the transferee to sign an assumption agreement that is acceptable to
Lend er and that obligates thetransferee to keep all the promises and agreements
made in the Note and in this Security Instrument. Borrower will continue to be
obligated under the Note and this Security Instrument unless Lender releases _
Borrower in writing.
lf Lender exercises the option to require immediate payment in full, Lender
shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of
not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section
15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument.
If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender
may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further
notice or demand on Borrower.
