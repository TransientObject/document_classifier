Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that may be required for Borrower’s escrow account under the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. Section 2601 et seq. and implementing regulations, 24
CFR Part 3500, as they may be amended from time to time ("RESPA"), except that the cushion or
reserve permitted by RESPA for unanticipated disbursements or disbursements before the Borrower’s
payments are available in the account may not be based on amounts due for the mortgage insurance
premium.
If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Items exceed the amounts permitted to be held by
RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. If the amounts of ~
funds held by Lender at any time are not sufficient to pay the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify
the Borrower and require Borrower to make up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.
The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this Security .
Instrument. If Borrower tenders to Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower’s account shall
be credited with the balance remaining for all installment items (a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage
insurance premium installment that Lender has not become obligated to pay to the Secretary, and
Lender shall promptly refund any excess funds to Borrower. Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of
the Property or its acquisition by Lender, Borrower’s account shall be credited with any balance
remaining for all installments for items (a), (b), and (c).
3. Application of Payments. All payments under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied by Lender
as follows:
ELLSI, to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly
charge by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance premium;
S.¢.QQ11d, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood and
other hazard insurance premiums, as required;
Ihind, to interest due under the Note;
EO.U.Lll11, to amortization of the principal of the Note; and
Fifth, to late charges due under the Note.
4. Fire, Flood and Other Hazard Insurance. Borrower shall insure all improvements on the
Property, whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against any hazards, casualties, and
contingencies, including fire, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in
the amounts and for the periods that Lender requires. Borrower shall also insure all improvements on
the Property, whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent
required by the Secretary. All insurance shall be carried with companies approved by Lender. The
insurance policies and any renewals shall be held by Lender and shall include loss payable clauses in
  favor of, and in a form acceptable to, Lender.
. In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and
directed to make payment for such loss directly to Lender, instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly.
All or any part of the insurance proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either (a) to the
reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent
amounts applied in the order in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal, or (b) to the
restoration or repair of the damaged Property. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not
extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change
the amount of such payments. Any excess insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all
outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally
entitled thereto.

principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender determines that
requirement will cause undue hardship for Borrower, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which
are beyond Borrower’s control. Borrower shall notify Lender of any extenuating circumstances.
I Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy, damage or substantially change the Property or allow the
, Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Lender may inspect the Property if the
  Property is vacant or abandoned or the loan is in default. Lender may take reasonable action to protect
l and preserve such vacant or abandoned Property. Borrower shall also be in default if Borrower, during
( the loan application process, gave materially false or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or
, failed to provide Lender with any material information) in connection with the loan evidenced by the
( Note, including, but not limited to, representations concerning Borrower’s occupancy of the Property as
  a principal residence. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with the
  provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and fee title shall not
  be merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
l 6. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in
l connection with any condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in place
  of condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender to the extent of the full amount of the
( indebtedness that remains unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument. Lender shall apply such
proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any
delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal.
Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly
payments, which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such payments. Any excess
proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this Security
Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
7. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender’s Rights in the Property. Borrower shall
pay all governmental or municipal charges, fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2.
Borrower shall pay these obligations on time directly to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure
to pay would adversely affect Lender’s interest in the Property, upon Lender’s request Borrower shall
promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing these payments.
If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to
perform any other covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal
proceeding that may significantly affect Lender’s rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in
bankruptcy, for condemnation or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever
is necessary to protect the value of the Property and Lender’s rights in the Property, including payment
of taxes, hazard insurance and other items mentioned in paragraph 2.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of
( Borrower and be secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of
  disbursement, at the Note rate, and at the option of Lender, shall be immediately due and payable.
  Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless
l Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner
( acceptable to Lender; (b) contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in,
  legal proceedings which in the Lender’s opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien; or (c)
  secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this
  Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which may
, attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien.
I Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above within l0 days of the
giving of notice.
i 8. Fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
I 9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.
, (a) Default. Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary, in the case of
, payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
t Instrument if:
  (i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security
  Instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or ,
(ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations  
contained in this Security Instrument.

GRSNT COUNTY TITLE
(b) Sale Without Credit Approval. Lender shall, if permitted by applicable law (including
Section 34l(d) of the Garn‘St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C.
1701 j‘3(d)) and with the prior approval of the Secretary, require immediate payment in full of I
all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) All or part of the Property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the
Property, is sold or otherwise transferred (other than by devise or descent), and T
(ii) The Property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal residence,  
or the purchaser or grantee does so occupy the Property but his or her credit has not been  
approved in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary. l
(c) No Waiver. If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require immediate
payment in full, but Lender does not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights
with respect to subsequent events.
(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary. In many circumstances regulations issued by the
Secretary will limit Lender’s rights, in the case of payment defaults, to require immediate
payment in full and foreclose if not paid. This Security Instrument does not authorize
acceleration or foreclosure if not permitted by regulations of the Secretary.
(e) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that if this Security Instrument and the Note are
not determined to be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 60 days from
the date hereof, Lender may, at its option, require immediate payment in full of all sums
secured by this Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary
dated subsequent to 60 days from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security Instrument
and the Note, shall be deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this option may not be exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is
solely due to Lender’s failure to remit a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary.
10. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate
payment in full because of Borrower’s failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security
Instrument. This right applies even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security
Instrument, Borrower shall tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower’s account
current including, to the extent they are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument,
foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary attorneys’ fees and expenses properly associated with the
y foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations
, that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required immediate payment in full. However,
  Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the
I commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately preceding the
I commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding, (ii) reinstatement will preclude foreclosure on
different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of the lien created
I by this Security Instrument.
11. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time of
payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by
Lender to any successor in interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original
Borrower or Borrower’s successor in interest. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings
against any successor in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization
of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower
or Borrower’s successors in interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall
not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
12. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-Signers. The covenants
and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender
and Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(b). Borrower’s covenants and agreements shall
be joint and several. Any Borrower who co‘signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note:
(a) is co‘signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower’s interest in
the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums
secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to
extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security
Instrument or the Note without that Borrower’s consent.

delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail unless applicable law requires use of another method. The
notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other address Borrower designates by notice to
Lender. Any notice to Lender shall be given by first class mail to Lender’s address stated herein or any
address Lender designates by notice to Borrower. Any notice provided for in this Security Instrument
shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower or Lender when given as provided in this paragraph.
l4. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be governed by Federal law and
, the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of
, this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other
l provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting
provision. To this end the provisions of this Security Instrument and the Note are declared to be
l severable.
  15. Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this
1 Security Instrument.
( 16. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal,
l storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow
anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property that is in violation of any Environmental Law. The
l preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small
j quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential
1 uses and to maintenance of the Property.
l Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or
l other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any
Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge. If Borrower
learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, that any removal or other remediation
of any Hazardous Substances affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all
necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law.
As used in this paragraph 16, "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or
hazardous substances by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other
flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials
containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials. As used in this paragraph 16,
"Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that
relate to health, safety or environmental protection.
NON‘UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
l7. Assignment of Rents. Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents
and revenues of the Property. Borrower authorizes Lender or Lender’s agents to collect the rents and
revenues and hereby directs each tenant of the Property to pay the rents to Lender or Lender’s agents.
However, prior to Lender’s notice to Borrower of Borrower’s breach of any covenant or agreement in the
Security Instrument, Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues of the Property as trustee
for the benefit of Lender and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes an absolute assignment and
not an assignment for additional security only.
If Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by
Borrower as trustee for benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security
Instrument; (b) Lender shall be entitled to collect and receive all of the rents of the Property; and (c)
each tenant of the Property shall pay all rents due and unpaid to Lender or Lender’s agent on Lender’s
written demand to the tenant.
Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perform any
act that would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this paragraph 17.
Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after
giving notice of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at
any time there is a breach. Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate any (
other right or remedy of Lender. This assignment of rents of the Property shall terminate when the debt ,
secured by the Security Instrument is paid in full. I

18. Foreclosure Procedure. If Lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph
9, Lender may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law.
Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in
this paragraph 18, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of title
evidence.
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall give written notice to Trustee of the
occurrence of an event of default and of Lender’s election to cause the Property to be sold.
Trustee and Lender shall take such action regarding notice of sale and shall give such notices to
Borrower and to other persons as applicable law may require. After the time required by
applicable law and after publication of the notice of sale, Trustee, without demand on
Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place
I and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order

( of sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.
y Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee’s deed conveying the Property without any
t covenant or warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee’s deed shall be prima
  facie evidence of the truth of the statements made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of
  the sale in the following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to,
( reasonable Trustee’s and attorneys’ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument;
i and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to it or to the clerk of the superior
) court of the county in which the sale took place.
  If the Lender’s interest in this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary and the
  Secretary requires immediate payment in full under paragraph 9, the Secretary may invoke
l the nonjudicial power of sale provided in the Single Family Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1994
) ("Act") (12 U.S.C. 3751 et seq. ) by requesting a foreclosure commissioner designated under
  the Act to commence foreclosure and to sell the Property as provided in the Act. Nothing in
the preceding sentence shall deprive the Secretary of any rights otherwise available to a Lender
under this paragraph 18 or applicable law.
l 19. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall
) request Trustee to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes
evidencing debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property
without warranty and without charge to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or
persons shall pay any recordation costs.
20. Substitute Trustee. In accordance with applicable law, Lender may from time to time appoint
a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed hereunder who has ceased to act. Without conveyance of the
Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title, power and duties conferred upon Trustee
herein and by applicable law.
2l. Use of Property. The Property is not used principally for agricultural or farming purposes.
22. Riders to this Security Instrument. If one or more riders are executed by Borrower and

rider(s) were a part of this Security Instrument. [Check applicable box(es)]. l
