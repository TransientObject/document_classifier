CORVALLIS, OR 97330 ("Grantor") and Oregon Coast Bank, whose address is Main Office, 909 SE Bay Blvd, P.O.
Box 2280, Newport, OR 97365 ("Lender").
DEED OF TRUST. Lender and Grantor have entered into a Deed of Trust dated May 11, 2006 (the "Deed of Trust") which has been recorded in
LINCOLN County, State of Oregon, as follows:
Recorded in the Lincoln County Clerks office on May 16, 2006; Document number 200607398; Modification of Deed of Trust recorded in
the Lincoln County Clerks office on August 29, 2007; Document number 200712492.
REAL PROPERTY DESCRIPTION. The Deed of Trust covers the following described real property located in LINCOLN County, State of Oregon:
Lot 7, Block 3, WAGGONER'S ADDITION TO SOUTH BEACH, in the City of Newport, County of Lincoln and State of Oregon.
The Real Property or its address is commonly known as 215 SW 29TH STREET, NEWPORT, OR 97365. The Real Property tax identification
number is 11-1 1—17-CA—2201 R302721.
MODIFICATION. Lender and Grantor hereby modify the Deed of Trust as follows:
The maturity date has been extended to May 11. 2008.
CONTINUING VALIDITY. Except as expressly modified above, the terms of the original Deed of Trust shall remain unchanged and in full force
and effect. Consent by Lender to this Modification does not waive Lender's right to require strict performance of the Deed of Trust as changed
above nor obligate Lender to make any future modifications. Nothing in this Modification shall constitute a satisfaction of the promissory note or
other credit agreement secured by the Deed of Trust (the "N0te"). It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable all parties to the Deed of Trust
and all parties, makers and endorsers to the Note, including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing.
Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, shall not be released by virtue of this Modification. If any person who signed the
original Deed of Trust does not sign this Modification, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Modification is given conditionally,
based on the representation to Lender that the non—signing person consents to the changes and provisions of this Modification or otherwise will
not be released by it. This waiver applies not only to any initial extension or modification, but also to all such subsequent actions.
GRANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES HAVING READ ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MODIFICATION OF DEED OF TRUST AND GRANTOR AGREES TO
ITS TERMS. THIS MODIFICATION OF DEED OF TRUST IS DATED FEBRUARY 29. 2008.
