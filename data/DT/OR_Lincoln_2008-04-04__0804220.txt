(B) to provide any required insurance on the Property, (C) to make repairs to the Property or to comply with any obligation to maintain Existing
Indebtedness in good standing as required below, then Lender may do so. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially
affect Lender's interests in the Property, then Lender on Grantor's behalf may, but is not required to, take any action that Lender believes to be
appropriate to protect Lender's interests. All expenses incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged
under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the
Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and
be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining
term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note‘s maturity.

Existing Lien. The lien of this Deed of Trust securing the Indebtedness may be secondary and inferior to an existing lien. Grantor expressly
covenants and agrees to pay, or see to the payment of, the Existing Indebtedness and to prevent any default on such indebtedness, any

with any of Grantor's obligations under this Deed of Trust, Trustee or Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and
remedies:
Election of Remedies. All of Lender's rights and remedies will be cumulative and may be exercised alone or together. An election by
Lender to choose any one remedy will not bar Lender from using any other remedy. If Lender decides to spend money or to perform any of
Grantor's obligations under this Deed of Trust, after Grantor's failure to do so, that decision by Lender will not affect Lender's right to
declare Grantor in default and to exercise Lender's remedies.

due and payable, including any prepayment penalty which Grantor would be required to pay.

judgment.
Other Remedies. Trustee or Lender shall have any other right or remedy provided in this Deed of Trust or the Note or available at law or in
equity.

sale or by separate sales. Lender shall be entitled to bid at any public sale on all or any portion of the Property.
Expenses. lf Lender institutes any suit or action to enforce any of the terms of this Deed of Trust, Lender shall be entitled to recover such
sum as the court may adjudge reasonable. Whether or not any court action is involved, and to the extent not prohibited by law, all
reasonable expenses Lender incurs that in Lender's opinion are necessary at any time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of
its rights shall become a part of the Indebtedness payable on demand and shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of the
expenditure until repaid. Expenses covered by this paragraph include, without limitation, however subject to any limits under applicable
law, Lender's expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and
any anticipated post-judgment collection services, the cost of searching records, obtaining title reports (including foreclosure reports),
surveyors' reports, and appraisal fees, title insurance, and fees for the Trustee, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Grantor also will
pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law.

upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state and county in which you reside or in which you signed this
instrument, whichever Lender chooses, and that venue is proper in such courts, provided that any judicial foreclosure action relating to any real
property security shall be commenced where the real property, or some part thereof, is located.
GOVERNING LAW. The interest rate and other terms of the credit evidenced or secured by this instrument (the "Credit") shall be governed by,
and this instrument shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with, federal laws and the laws of the State of Oregon, without
regard to principles of conflicts of law, except that (1) procedural matters related to the perfection and enforcement of the rights and remedies

property securing the Credit shall be governed by the laws of the state where the person granting that security interest is located. This
instrument has been accepted by Lender in the State of Oregon.
