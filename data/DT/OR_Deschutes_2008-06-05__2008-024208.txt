MODIFICATION TO HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT
AGREEMENT AND LINE OF CREDIT TRUST DEED 50
This Modification Agreement (this "Agreement") is made this 15TH DAY OF MAY, 2008, between Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (the "Lender") and JAMES J BICKLER AND KAREN L BICKLER, HUSBAND AND WIFE,
AS TENAN TS BY EN TIRETY (individually and collectively, the "Borrower").
Borrower has entered into a home equity line of credit agreement (the "Line of Credit Agreement") with the Lender,
dated March 13, 2008, in the original maximum principal amount of $ 55,000.00. The Line of Credit Agreement is
secured by a deed of trust dated the same date as the Line of Credit Agreement (together with any renewals,
extensions, and modifications to it made prior to the date of this Agreement ), which is recorded in Book/Roll
at page(s) of the County of DESCHUTES County, State of Oregon as document No. 2008-16130 */
(the "Security Instrument"), and covering real property located at 61481 TAM MCARTHUR LOOP, BEND,
OREGON 97702 (the "Property") and described as follows:
SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
The Borrower has requested and the Lender has agreed to modify certain terms of the Line of Credit Agreement and
the Security Instrument as set forth below. All terms not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meanings as
set forth in the Line of Credit Agreement.
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:
Change in Credit Limit. The Lender and the Borrower agree that the credit limit under the Line of Credit
Agreement is hereby increased to $71,000.00 and that the lien of the Security Instrument shall secure the line of
credit up to that amount as it is advanced and outstanding from time to time.
OR LOC Modification A rmt, HCWF#269v7 (01/22/07) l/5

— L  i

Each reference in the Security Instrument to the maximum amount of the line of credit is hereby
amended to the extent necessary to reflect the modified credit limit.
As a precondition to making the changes set forth above, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Lender at the
time of signing this Agreement the other finance charges and other charges that are enumerated and disclosed on the
attached final HUD Settlement Statement which is integrated by reference into this Agreement.
Except as amended by this Agreement, all terms and conditions of the Line of Credit Agreement and the Security
Instrument (including any previous modifications) shall remain in full force and effect, and this Agreement shall not
affect the Lender’s security interest in, or lien priority on, the Property. The Borrower agrees to be bound by and to
perform all of the covenants and agreements in the Line of Credit Agreement and the Security Instrument at the time
and in the manner therein provided.
This Agreement shall not be construed to be a satisfaction, novation or partial release of the Line of Credit
Agreement or the Security Instrument.
By signing this Agreement, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender that the Borrower has no
counterclaims, set-offs or defenses to the Bank’s rights under the Line of Credit Agreement or the Security
Instrument.
The Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse the Lender for any and all fees payable to public officials in connection
with this Agreement, and the recording thereof, including any mortgage registry tax that may be due.
Borrower hereby acknowledges Borrower has received, read and retained a copy of the Agreement and the HUD
Settlement Statement provided to me by Lender, all of which I agree to by signing this Agreement.
— This Agreement does not increase or extend any revolving credit insurance Borrower purchased in connection with
the line of credit. Credit insurance means credit life, credit accident and health and/or credit disability insurance.
C0-Trustor/C0-Mortgagor Liability. As to any Borrower who signed the Security Instrument, but who did not
execute the Line of Credit Agreement (a "co-trustor/co-mortgagor"), this Agreement does not modify, change or
terminate the nature of the co—trustor/co—mortgagor’s obligations in connection with the line of credit. The co-
trustor/co—mortgagor is not personally obligated to pay the debt evidenced by the Line of Credit Agreement and the
Security Instrument (as renewed, extended, and amended hereby). The co-trustor/co-mortgagor agrees that the
Lender and the Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the
terms of the Line of Credit Agreement or the Security Instrument (as renewed, extended, and amended hereby)
without the co—trustor/co—mortgagor’s consent.
The Borrower and the Lender have executed this Agreement under seal as of the day and year first above written. ,
