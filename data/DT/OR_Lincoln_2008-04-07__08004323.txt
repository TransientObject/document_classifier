for services rendered or material furnished to the Property. Grantor shall maintain the Property free of all liens having priority over or equal
to the interest of Lender under this Deed of Trust, except for the lien of taxes and assessments not due and except as otherwise provided
in this Deed of Trust.
Right to Contest. Grantor may withhold payment of any tax, assessment, or claim in connection with a good faith dispute over the
obligation to pay, so long as Lender's interest in the Property is not jeopardized. If a lien arises or is filed as a result of nonpayment,
Grantor shall within fifteen (15) days after the lien arises or, if a lien is filed, within fifteen (15) days after Grantor has notice of the filing,
secure the discharge of the lien, or if requested by Lender, deposit with Lender cash or a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security
satisfactory to Lender in an amount sufficient to discharge the lien plus any costs and attorneys' fees, or other charges that could accrue
as a result of a foreclosure or sale under the lien. In any contest, Grantor shall defend itself and Lender and shall satisfy any adverse
judgment before enforcement against the Property. Grantor shall name Lender as an additional obligee under any surety bond furnished in
the contest proceedings.
Evidence of Payment. Grantor shall upon demand furnish to Lender satisfactory evidence of payment of the taxes or assessments and shall
authorize the appropriate governmental official to deliver to Lender at any time a written statement of the taxes and assessments against
the Property.
Notice of Construction. Grantor shall notify Lender at least fifteen (15) days before any work is commenced, any services are furnished, or
any materials are supplied to the Property, if any mechanic's lien, materialmen's lien, or other lien could be asserted on account of the
work, services, or materials. Grantor will upon request of Lender furnish to Lender advance assurances satisfactory to Lender that Grantor
can and will pay the cost of such improvements.
PROPERTY DAMAGE INSURANCE. The following provisions relating to insuring the Property are a part of this Deed of Trust.
Maintenance of Insurance. Grantor shall procure and maintain policies of fire insurance with standard extended coverage endorsements on
a replacement basis for the full insurable value covering all Improvements on the Real Property in an amount sufficient to avoid application
of any coinsurance clause, and with a standard mortgagee clause in favor of Lender. Grantor shall also procure and maintain
comprehensive general liability insurance in such coverage amounts as Lender may request with Trustee and Lender being named as
additional insureds in such liability insurance policies. Additionally, Grantor shall maintain such other insurance, including but not limited to
hazard, business interruption, and boiler insurance, as Lender may reasonably require. Policies shall be written in form, amounts, coverages
and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender and issued by a company or companies reasonably acceptable to Lender. Grantor, upon request
of Lender, will deliver to Lender from time to time the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender, including
stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least ten (10) days prior written notice to Lender. Each insurance
policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by any act, omission or
default of Grantor or any other person. Should the Real Property be located in an area designated by the Director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as a special flood hazard area, Grantor agrees to obtain and maintain Federal Flood Insurance, if available, within 45
days after notice is given by Lender that the Property is located in a special flood hazard area, for the full unpaid principal balance of the
loan and any prior liens on the property securing the loan, up to the maximum policy limits set under the National Flood Insurance Program,
or as otherwise required by Lender, and to maintain such insurance for the term of the loan.
Application of Proceeds. Grantor shall promptly notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Property. Lender may make proof of loss if
Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty. Whether or not Lender's security is impaired, Lender may, at Lender's
election, receive and retain the proceeds of any insurance and apply the proceeds to the reduction of the Indebtedness, payment of any lien
affecting the Property, or the restoration and repair of the Property. lf Lender elects to apply the proceeds to restoration and repair, Grantor
shall repair or replace the damaged or destroyed Improvements in a manner satisfactory to Lender. Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of

DEED OF TRUST
Loan No: 0000000018 (C0l1tlnu6d) Page 3
 
such expenditure, pay or reimburse Grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration if Grantor is not in default
under this Deed of Trust. Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within 180 days after their receipt and which Lender has not
committed to the repair or restoration of the Property shall be used first to pay any amount owing to Lender under this Deed of Trust, then
to pay accrued interest, and the remainder, if any, shall be applied to the principal balance of the Indebtedness. If Lender holds any
proceeds after payment in full of the Indebtedness, such proceeds shall be paid to Grantor as Grantor‘s interests may appear.
Grantor‘s Report on Insurance. Upon request of Lender, however not more than once a year, Grantor shall furnish to Lender a report on
each existing policy of insurance showing: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the
property insured, the then current replacement value of such property, and the manner of determining that value; and (5) the expiration
date of the policy. Grantor shall, upon request of Lender, have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine the cash value
replacement cost of the Property.
LENDER'S EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Property or if Grantor
fails to comply with any provision of this Deed of Trust or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor's failure to discharge or
pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Deed of Trust or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor‘s
behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all
taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Property and paying all costs for insuring,
maintaining and preserving the Property. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate
charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of
the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among
and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the
remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity. The Deed of Trust
also will secure payment of these amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon
Default.
WARRANTY: DEFENSE OF TITLE. The following provisions relating to ownership of the Property are a part of this Deed of Trust:
Title. Grantor warrants that: la) Grantor holds good and marketable title of record to the Property in fee simple, free and clear of all liens

time to permit such participation.

ordinances, and regulations of governmental authorities.
Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations, warranties, and agreements made by Grantor in this Deed of Trust shall

CONDEMNATION. The following provisions relating to condemnation proceedings are a part of this Deed of Trust:
Proceedings. lf any proceeding in condemnation is filed, Grantor shall promptly notify Lender in writing, and Grantor shall promptly take

will deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender such instruments and documentation as may be requested by Lender from time to time to
permit such participation.

repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against any property securing the
Indebtedness. This includes a garnishment of any of Grantor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of
Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the
creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender
monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an
adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.
Breach of Other Agreement. Any breach by Grantor under the terms of any other agreement between Grantor and Lender that is not

Election of Remedies. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make

due and payable, including any prepayment penalty which Grantor would be required to pay.

Lender shall have the right to foreclose by judicial foreclosure, in either case in accordance with and to the full extent provided by
applicable law. lf this Deed of Trust is foreclosed by judicial foreclosure, Lender will be entitled to a judgment which will provide that if the
foreclosure sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the judgment, execution may issue for the amount of the unpaid balance of the
judgment.
UCC Remedies. With respect to all or any part of the Personal Property, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party

receiver.
Appoint Receiver. Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Property, with the
power to protect and preserve the Property, to operate the Property preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the Rents from the
Property and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness. The receiver may serve without
bond if permitted by law. Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Property
exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount. Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver.
Tenancy at Sufferance. If Grantor remains in possession of the Property after the Property is sold as provided above or Lender otherwise
becomes entitled to possession of the Property upon default of Grantor, Grantor shall become a tenant at sufferance of Lender or the
purchaser of the Property and shall, at Lender's option, either (1) pay a reasonable rental for the use of the Property, or (2) vacate the
Property immediately upon the demand of Lender.
Other Remedies. Trustee or Lender shall have any other right or remedy provided in this Deed of Trust or the Note or available at law or in
equity.
Notice of Sale. Lender shall give Grantor reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale of the Personal Property or of the time
after which any private sale or other intended disposition of the Personal Property is to be made. Reasonable notice shall mean notice
given at least fifteen (I5) days before the time of the sale or disposition. Any sale of the Personal Property may be made in conjunction
with any sale of the Real Property.
Sale of the Property. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor hereby waives any and all rights to have the Property marshalled.
In exercising its rights and remedies, the Trustee or Lender shall be free to sell all or any part of the Property together or separately, in one
sale or by separate sales. Lender shall be entitled to bid at any public sale on all or any portion of the Property.
Attorneys' Fees; Expenses. If Lender institutes any suit or action to enforce any of the terms of this Deed of Trust, Lender shall be entitled
to recover such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorneys' fees at trial and upon any appeal. Whether or not any court action
is involved, and to the extent not prohibited by law, all reasonable expenses Lender incurs that in Lender's opinion are necessary at any
time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of its rights shall become a part of the Indebtedness payable on demand and shall
bear interest at the Note rate from the date of the expenditure until repaid. Expenses covered by this paragraph include, without limitation,
however subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit,
including attorneys' fees and expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction),
