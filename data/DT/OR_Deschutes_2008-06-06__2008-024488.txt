TOGETHER WITH all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property, and all easements,
appurtenances, and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property. All replacements and additions shall also be
covered by this Security Instrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the "Property. "
Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security
Instrument; but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender's successors
and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose
and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to, releasing or canceling
this Security Instrument.
BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to
grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower
warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any
encumbrances of record.
THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non·urriforrn covenants with
limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a urriforrn security instrument covering real property.
UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:
1. Payment of Principal, Interest and Late Charge. Borrower shall pay when due the principal of, and
interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and late charges due under the Note.
2. Monthly Payment of Taxes, Insurance, and Other Charges. Borrower shall include in each monthly
payment, together with the principal and interest as set forth in the Note and any late charges, a sum for (a) taxes and
special assessments levied or to be levied against the Property, (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the
Property, and (c) premiums for insurance required under paragraph 4. In any year in which the Lender must pay a
mortgage insurance prenrium to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ("Secretary"), or in any year in
which such premium would have been required if Lender still held the Security Instrument, each monthly payment
shall also include either: (i) a sum for the amrual mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary,
or (ii) a monthly charge instead of a mortgage insurance premium if this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary,
in a reasonable amount to be determined by the Secretary. Except for the monthly charge by the Secretary, these items
are called "Escrow Items" and the sums paid to Lender are called "Escrow Funds."
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold amounts for Escrow Items in an aggregate amount not to exceed the
maximum amount that may be required for Borrower's escrow account under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. §260l g gl. and implementing regulations, 24 CFR Part 3500, as they may be amended
from time to time ("RESPA") , except that the cushion or reserve permitted by RESPA for unanticipated disbursements
or disbursements before the Borrower's payments are available in the account may not be based on amounts due for
the mortgage insurance premium.
If the amounts held by Lender for Escrow Itenrs exceed the amounts permitted to be held by RESPA, Lender shall
account to Borrower for the excess funds as required by RESPA. If the amounts of funds held by Lender at any time
FHA OREGON DEED OF TRUST - MERS DgcMagic 2Fg;n;s; 800-64,9-1362
6/96 PBQG 2 of T0 www.dacmagic.com

are not sufficient to pay the Escrow Items when due, Lender may notify the Borrower and require Borrower to make
up the shortage as permitted by RESPA.
The Escrow Funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If
Borrower tenders to Lender the full payment of all such sums, Borrower's account shall be credited with the balance
remaining for all installment items (a), (b), and (c) and any mortgage insurance premium installment that Lender has
not become obligated to pay to the Secretary, and Lender shall promptly refund any excess funds to Borrower.
Immediately prior to a foreclosure sale of the Property or its acquisition by Lender, Borrower's account shall be
credited with any balance remaining for all installments for items (a), (b), and (c).
3. Application of Payments. All payments under paragraphs land 2 shall be applied by Lender as follows:
FIRST, to the mortgage insurance premium to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or to the monthly charge
by the Secretary instead of the monthly mortgage insurance premium;
SECOND, to any taxes, special assessments, leasehold payments or ground rents, and fire, flood and other
hazard insurance premiums, as required;
THIRD, to interest due under the Note;
FOURTH, to amortization of the principal of the Note; and
FIFTH, to late charges due under the Note.
4. Fire, Flood and Other Hazard Insurance. Borrower shall insure all improvements on the Property,
whether now in existence or subsequently erected, against any hazards, casualties, and contingencies, including fire,
for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for the periods that
Lender requires. Borrower shall also insure all improvements on the Property, whether now in existence or
subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent required by the Secretary. All insurance shall be carried with
companies approved by Lender. The insurance policies and any renewals shall be held by Lender and shall include
loss payable clauses in favor of, and in a form acceptable to, Lender.
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give Lender immediate notice by mail. Lender may make proof of loss if not
made promptly by Borrower. Each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and directed to nrake payment
for such loss directly to Lender, instead of to Borrower and to Lender jointly. All or any part of the insurance
proceeds may be applied by Lender, at its option, either (a) to the reduction of the indebtedness under the Note and
this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order in paragraph 3, and then to prepayment
of principal, or (b) to the restoration or repair of the damaged Property. Any application of the proceeds to the
principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the monthly payments which are referred to in paragraph 2, or
change the amount of such payments. Any excess insurance proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding
indebtedness under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
In the event of foreclosure of this Security Instrument or other transfer of title to the Property that extinguishes the
indebtedness, all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to insurance policies in force shall pass to the purchaser.
5. Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Borrower's Loan Application;
Leaseholds. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence within sixty
days after the execution of this Security Instrument (or within sixty days of a later sale or transfer of the Property)
and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of
occupancy, unless the Lender determines that requirement will cause undue hardship for Borrower, or unless
extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control. Borrower shall notify Lender of any
extenuating circumstances. Borrower shall not commit waste or destroy, damage or substantially change the Property
or allow the Property to deteriorate, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Lender may inspect the Property if the
Property is vacant or abandoned or the loan is in default. Lender may take reasonable action to protect and preserve
such vacant or abandoned Property. Borrower shall also be in default if Borrower, during the loan application
process, gave materially false or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with any
material information) in connection with the loan evidenced by the Note, including, but not limited to, representations
concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as a principal residence. If this Security Instrument is on a
leasehold, Borrower shall comply with the provisions of the lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the
leasehold and fee title shall not be merged unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.
6. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential, in comrection
with any condemnation or other taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in place of condemnation, are
FHA OREGON DEED OF TRUST — MERS D¤¢Magic ¤Fonne· soo-s4s-1362
6/96 P696 3 Of T0 www. docmagic. cam

p hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender to the extent of the full amount of the indebtedness that remains unpaid
A under the Note and this Security Instrument. Lender shall apply such proceeds to the reduction of the indebtedness
1 under the Note and this Security Instrument, first to any delinquent amounts applied in the order provided in
T paragraph 3, and then to prepayment of principal. Any application of the proceeds to the principal shall not extend
or postpone the due date of the monthly payments, which are referred to in paragraph 2, or change the amount of such
payments. Any excess proceeds over an amount required to pay all outstanding indebtedness under the Note and this
Security Instrument shall be paid to the entity legally entitled thereto.
7. Charges to Borrower and Protection of Lender's Rights in the Property. Borrower shall pay all
governmental or municipal charges, fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph 2. Borrower shall pay _
these obligations on time directly to the entity which is owed the payment. If failure to pay would adversely affect
Lender's interest in the Property, upon Lender's request Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts
evidencing these payments.
If Borrower fails to make these payments or the payments required by paragraph 2, or fails to perform any other
covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that may significantly
affect Lender's rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, for condennration or to enforce laws or
regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and Lender's
rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard insurance and other items mentioned in paragraph 2.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph shall become an additional debt of Borrower and be
secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the Note rate,
and at the option of Lender shall be inrrnediately due and payable.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower:
(a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a marmer acceptable to Lender; (b) contests
in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in the Lender's
opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement
satisfactory to Lender subordirrating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the
Property is subject to a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a
notice identifying the lien. Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above within
10 days of the giving of notice.
8. Fees. Lender may collect fees and charges authorized by the Secretary.
9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.
(a) Default. Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary in the case of payment
defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security
Instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or
(ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations
contained in this Security Instrument.
(b) Sale Without Credit Approval. Lender shall, if permitted by applicable law (including section 34l(d)
of the Garn—St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, 12 U.S.C. 1701-3(d)) and with the prior
approval of the Secretary, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:
(i) All or part of the Property, or a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the Property, is
sold or otherwise transferred (other than by devise or descent), and
(ii) The Property is not occupied by the purchaser or grantee as his or her principal residence, or the
purchaser or grantee does so occupy the Property, but his or her credit has not been approved in
accordance with the requirements of the Secretary.
(c) No Waiver. If circumstances occur that would permit Lender to require irmnediate payment in full,
but Lender does not require such payments, Lender does not waive its rights with respect to subsequent
events.
(d) Regulations of HUD Secretary. In many circumstances regulations issued by the Secretary will limit
Lender's rights, in the case of payment defaults, to require inrrnediate payment in full and foreclose if not
paid. This Security Instrument does not authorize acceleration or foreclosure if not permitted by regulations
of the Secretary.
FHA OREGON DEED OF TRUST - MERS DocMagic   soo-649-1262
6/96 Page 4 of 10 www. dacmagic. com

(e) Mortgage Not Insured. Borrower agrees that if this Security Instrument and the Note are not
determined to be eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act within 6 O DAYS
l from the date hereof, Lender may, at its option require inrrnediate payment in full of all sums secured by this
  Security Instrument. A written statement of any authorized agent of the Secretary dated subsequent to
6 0 DAYS from the date hereof, declining to insure this Security Instrument and
the Note, shall be deemed conclusive proof of such ineligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option
may not be exercised by Lender when the unavailability of insurance is solely due to Lender' s failure to remit
a mortgage insurance premium to the Secretary.
10. Reinstatement. Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate payment in full
, because of Borrower's failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This right applies
i even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower shall tender in a
  lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower's account current including, to the extent they are obligations of
· Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary attorneys' fees and expenses
properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and
the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required immediate payment in full.
However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the
commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately preceding the commencement of a current
foreclosure proceeding, (ii) reinstatement will preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or (iii)
reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of the lien created by this Security Instrument.
11. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance by Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time of payment or
modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to any successor in
interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of the original Borrower or Borrower's successors in
interest. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any successor in interest or refuse to extend
time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Secrnity Instrument by reason of any
demand made by the original Borrower or Borrower' s successors in interest. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising
any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.
12. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability; Co-Signers. The covenants and agreements
of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower, subject to the
provisions of paragraph 9(b). Borrower's covenants and agreements shall be joint and several. Any Borrower who
co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note: (a) is co—sigrring this Security Instrument only to
mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b)
is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any
other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the ternrs of this
Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower's consent.
13. Notices. Any notice to Borrower provided for in this Security Instrument shall be given by delivering it or
by mailing it by Hrst class mail unless applicable law requires use of another method. The notice shall be directed
to the Property Address or any other address Borrower designates by notice to Lender. Any notice to Lender shall
be given by first class mail to Lender‘s address stated herein or any address Lender designates by notice to Borrower.
Any notice provided for in this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower or Lender when
given as provided in this paragraph.
14. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of
the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument
or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument
or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision. To this end the provisions of this Security
Instrument and the Note are declared to be severable.
15. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one conformed copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
16. Hazardous Substances. Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release
of any Hazardous Substances on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything
affecting the Property that is in violation of any Environmental Law. The preceding two sentences shall not apply
to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally
recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property.
FHA OREGON DEED OF TRUST - MERS Dg;;Magic 2F@,yns; .904).549.1352
6/96 Page 5 of TO www.docmagic.c0m

Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action
by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or
Enviromnental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge. lf Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental
or regulatory authority, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substances affecting the Property
is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law.
As used in this paragraph 16, "Hazardous Substances" are those substances defined as toxic or hazardous
I substances by Enviromnental Law and the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic
{ petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde,
  and radioactive materials. As used in this paragraph 16, "Environmental Law" means federal laws and laws of the
I jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or enviromnental protection.
NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
17. Assignment of Rents. Borrower unconditionally assigns and transfers to Lender all the rents and
revenues of the Property. Borrower authorizes Lender or Lender's agents to collect the rents and revenues and
hereby directs each tenant of the Property to pay the rents to Lender or Lender's agents. However, prior to
Lender's notice to Borrower of Borrower‘s breach of any covenant or agreement in the Security Instrument,
Borrower shall collect and receive all rents and revenues of the Property as trustee for the benefit of Lender
and Borrower. This assignment of rents constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional
security only.
If Lender gives notice of breach to Borrower: (a) all rents received by Borrower shall be held by Borrower as
trustee for benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument; (b) Lender shall be
entitled to collect and receive all of the rents of the Properry; and (c) each tenant of the Property shall pay all rents
due and unpaid to Lender or Lender's agent on Lender's written demand to the tenant.
Borrower has not executed any prior assignment of the rents and has not and will not perform any act that would
prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this paragraph 17.
Lender shall not be required to enter upon, take control of or maintain the Property before or after giving notice
of breach to Borrower. However, Lender or a judicially appointed receiver may do so at any time there is a breach.
Any application of rents shall not cure or waive any default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender. This
assigmnent of rents of the Property shall terminate when the debt secured by the Security Instrument is paid in full.
18. Foreclosure Procedure. If Lender requires irnrnediate payment in full under paragraph 9, Lender may
invoke the power of sale and any other remedies pernritted by applicable law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all
expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph 18, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys‘ fees and costs of title evidence.
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender shall execute or cause Trustee to execute a written notice of the
occurrence of an event of default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold and shall cause such notice
to be recorded in each county in which any part of the Property is located. Lender or Trustee shall give notice of sale
in the mamrer prescribed by applicable law to Borrower and to the other persons prescribed by applicable law. After
the time required by applicable law, Trustee, without demand on Borrower, shall sell the Property at public auction
to the highest bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels
and in any order Trustee deternrines. Trustee may postpone sale of all or any parcel of the Property by public
announcement at the time and place of any previously scheduled sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the
Property at any sale.
Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser Trustee's deed conveying the Property without any covenant or warranty,
expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee's deed shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of the statements
made therein. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale,
including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys‘ fees; (b) to all sums secured by this Security
Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally entitled to it.
lf the Lender's interest in this Security Instrument is held by the Secretary and the Secretary requires immediate
payment in full under paragraph 9, the Secretary may invoke the nonjudicial power of sale provided in the Single
Family Morrgage Foreclosure Act of 1994 ("Act") (12 U.S.C. 3751 g gr.) by requesting a foreclosure connnissioner
: FHA OREGON DEED OF TRUST — NIEHS DgcMagic hF@;yyys; 800-649-1362
1 6/96 PBQB 6 Of 10 www.dacmagic.c0m

designated under the Act to commence foreclosure and to sell the Property as provided in the Act. Nothing in the
preceding sentence shall deprive the Secretary of any rights otherwise available to a Lender under this paragraph 18
or applicable law.
19. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall request Trustee
to reconvey the Property and shall surrender this Security Instrument and all notes evidencing debt secured by this
Security Instrument to Trustee. Trustee shall reconvey the Property without warranty to the person or persons legally
entitled to it. Lender may charge such person or persons a fee for reconveying the Property, if the fee is paid to a
third party Trustee for services rendered and charging of the fee is permitted under applicable law. Such person or
persons shall pay any recordation costs.
20. Substitute Trustee. Lender may from time to time remove Trustee and appoint a successor trustee to any
Trustee appointed hereunder. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title,
power and duties conferred upon Trustee herein and by applicable law.
21. Attorneys' Fees. As used in this Security Instrument and in the Note, "attomeys' fees" shall include any
attorneys' fees awarded by an appellate court.
22. Riders to this Security Instrument. If one or more riders are executed by Borrower and recorded together
with this Security Instrument, the covenants of each such rider shall be incorporated into and shall amend and
supplement the covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument as if the rider(s) were a part of this Security
Instrument.

WARNING
Unless you provide us with evidence of the insurance coverage as required by our contract or loan
agreement, we may purchase insurance at your expense to protect our interest. This insurance may,
but need not, also protect your interest. If the collateral becomes damaged, the coverage we purchase
may not pay any claim you make or any claim made against you. You may later cancel this coverage
by providing evidence that you have obtained property coverage elsewhere.
You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost of this insurance may
be added to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your contract or loan balance, the
interest rate on the underlying contract or loan will apply to this added amount. The effective date of
coverage may be the date your prior coverage lapsed or the date you failed to provide proof of coverage.
The coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance you can obtain on
your own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or any mandatory liability
insurance requirements imposed by applicable law.
BY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms contained in pages 1 through 10 of this Security
Instrument and in any rider(s) executed by Borrower and recorded with it.
