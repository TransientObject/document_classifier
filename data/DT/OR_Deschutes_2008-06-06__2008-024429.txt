15. Successors and Assigns Bound; Agents; Captions; Time of Essence. The provisions
of this Instrument shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, Trustor, Trustee and
Beneficiary and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and permitted (
assigns. In exercising any rights or taking any actions under this Instrument, Beneficiary  
or Trustee may act through its employees, agents or independent contractors. The
captions and headings of the paragraphs of this Instrument are for reference and
convenience only and are not to be used to limit, interpret or define its provisions. Time
is of the essence with respect to each and every covenant, agreement, obligation and
provision within this Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability. THIS INSTRUMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, TO
THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BY THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WITH RESPECT TO
THE CREATION, PERFECTION AND PRIORITY OF THE LIEN AND INTEREST
GRANTED HEREIN AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE FORECLOSURE AND
RECEIVERSHIP REMEDIES HEREIN, THIS INSTRUMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE PROPERTY
IS LOCATED.
In case any provision in or obligation under this Instrument shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation, shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.
17. Waiver of Marshaling and Certain Other Laws. Trustor waives to the full extent that
it may lawfully so do, the benefit of certain laws that afford the right to have the Property
or any portion thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure of the lien and interest hereof, to
the extent provided in the Loan Agreement. To the extent permitted by law, Trustor does
hereby expressly waive any and all rights of redemption from sale under any order or
decree of foreclosure of this Instrument on behalf of Trustee, the trust estate and all
persons beneficially interested therein and each and every person, acquiring any interest
in or title to the Property subsequent to the date of this Instrument. Trustor waives any
12
US2000 10467360.2

 
and all rights of setoff it may have against Beneficiary or Trustor specifically waives any
rights it may have as set forth in Oregon Code of Civil Procedure § 431.70.
18. Relationship of Parties; Third Party Beneficiary. No right or benefit conferred on
Beneficiary or Trustee under this Instrument shall constitute or be deemed to constitute
Beneficiary a partner or a joint venturer with Trustor. Trustor, Trustee and Beneficiary
specifically acknowledge that the relationship between Trustor and Beneficiary is solely
that of borrower and agent for the Secured Creditors with respect to the Secured
Obligations, and that all payments required to be made by Trustor to Beneficiary under
this Instrument and other Loan Documents are required solely by reason of that
relationship. All rights, interests and privileges conferred on Beneficiary and Trustee by
this Instrument are for the sole and exclusive benefit of Trustee, Beneficiary and Secured
Creditors, and shall not create any third party beneficiary rights unless expressly agreed
in writing by Beneficiary and Trustee.
19. Assignment of Rents and Leases. Trustor, absolutely and not collaterally, assigns and
transfers to Beneficiary all right, title and interest of Trustor in any and all Leases and
other leases, licenses or other grants of right to use the Property or any portion thereof,
now existing or hereafter entered into, and all the rents and revenues of the Property due
by virtue of any Leases, other leases or other licenses, or agreements for the occupancy or
use of all or any part of the Property. Trustor authorizes Beneficiary to collect all rents
and revenues, including Rents under the Leases and hereby directs each tenant of the
Property to pay rents directly to Beneficiary; provided, however, that, except after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under this Instrument,
Trustor shall have a license to collect and receive all rents and revenues of the Property
and to enjoy the use thereof (subject to the tenns of the Loan Documents). It is the intent
of Trustor and Beneficiary that the assignment of rents constitutes a present, absolute and
unconditional assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. After the
occurrence of an Event of Default under this Instrument and so long as such Event of
Default shall be continuing, and without the necessity of Beneficiary entering upon and
taking full control of the Property, in person, by agent or by a court-appointed receiver,
Beneficiary shall immediately be entitled to possession of all rents and revenues of the
Property both past due and unpaid and as they become due and payable. After the
occurrence of an Event of Default under this Instrument and so long as such Event of
Default shall be continuing, all such rents held, or thereafter received, by Trustor shall be
held as trustee for the benefit of Beneficiary only. After the occurrence of an Event of
Default under this Instrument and so long as such Event of Default shall be continuing,
Trustor agrees that each tenant of the Property shall be entitled to pay rents directly to
Beneficiary on Beneficiary’s written demand to each tenant delivered to each tenant
personally, by mail, without any obligation on the part of any tenant to inquire as to the
existence of an Event of Default by Trustor.
Trustor covenants that Trustor has not executed any prior assignment of rents or of rights
tmder the Leases, that Trustor has not performed, and will not perform, any acts or has
not executed, and will not execute, any instrtunent which would prevent Beneficiary from
exercising its rights under this paragraph 19, and that at the time of execution of this
13
US2000 10467360.2

 
Instrument there has been no prepayment of any of the rents of the Property for more than
two (2) months prior to the due date of such rents. Trustor agrees that Trustor will not
after the date of this Instrument collect or accept payment of any rents of the Property
more than two (2) months prior to the due dates of such rents. Trustor further agrees that
Trustor will deliver to Beneficiary additional assigmnents of rents and revenues of the
Property as Beneficiary may from time to time request.
All rents and revenues actually collected by Beneficiary, if any, in connection with this
paragraph 19 shall be applied to the Secured Obligations in such mamier as the Secured
Creditors shall determine, or if such application is prescribed in the Loan Agreement, as
provided in the Loan Agreement.
20. Appointment of Receiver. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default hereunder, Beneficiary, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction,
shall be entitled as a matter of strict right to the appointment of a receiver of the Property,
whether or not Beneficiary or Trustee shall simultaneously exercise any of their other
rights and remedies under this Instrument. To the full extent permitted by Applicable
Law, such appointment may be made without Notice, without bond, without regard to the
solvency or insolvency of Trustor or any other Person liable for payment of any portion
of the Secured Obligations at the time of application for such receiver and without regard
to the then value or occupancy of the Property, and Beneficiary or any other holder
hereof may be appointed as such receiver. Trustor hereby consents to the continuation of
such receivership for as long as Beneficiary deems necessary or appropriate, unless ,
otherwise provided by Applicable Law. Trustor hereby irrevocably consents to the 1
appointment of such receiver and waives all notice thereof. Such receiver shall have the
power to collect the rents, issues and profits of the Property and to extend, cancel or
modify any then existing leases and to make new leases, which extensions, modifications
and new leases may provide for terms to expire, or for options to lessees to extend or
renew terms to expire, beyond the maturity dates of the Secured Obligations and beyond
the date of the issuance of a deed or deeds to a purchaser or purchasers at a foreclosure
sale, it being rmderstood and agreed that any such leases, and the options or other such
provisions to be contained therein, shall be binding upon Trustor and all Persons whose
interests in the Property are subject to this Instrument. Such receiver shall have all other
powers which may be necessary or are usual in such cases for the protection, possession,
control, management and operation of the Property.
Notwithstanding the appointment of a receiver, if such receiver is not the Beneficiary, the
Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to retain possession and
control of all cash held by or deposited with it or its agents or co-agents (including any
amounts accruing to it by virtue of provisions regarding insurance or condemnation
awards) pursuant to any provision of this Instrrunent or any Loan Document.
2l. Assignment by Beneficiary. Subj ect to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the interest of
Beneficiary in this Instrument is, at Beneficiary’s option, assignable and any assignment
hereof by Beneficiary shall operate to vest in the assignee all rights, title, interests and
powers in this Instrument conferred upon and granted to Beneficiary.
14
US2000 10467360.2

 
22. Withdrawal or Discontinuance of Proceedings. To the full extent permitted by
Applicable Law, in case Beneficiary or Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right,
power or remedy under this Instrument by foreclosure, entry or otherwise or in the event
Beneficiary or Trustee shall have cornrnenced advertising the intended exercise of the
right of foreclosure provided hereunder, and such proceeding or advertisement shall have
been withdrawn, discontinued or abandoned for any reason (except a cure of all existing
Events of Default in accordance with the Loan Agreement), or shall have been
determined adversely to Beneficiary or Trustee, then in every such case (i) Trustor, any
other Person liable for payment of any of the Secured Obligations, Beneficiary and
Trustee shall be restored to their former positions and rights, (ii) all rights, powers and
remedies of Beneficiary and Trustee shall continue as if no such proceeding had been
taken, (iii) each and every Event of Default declared or occurring prior or subsequent to
such withdrawal, discontinuance or abandonment shall and shall be deemed to be a
continuing Event of Default, and (iv) this Instrument and any other Loan Document shall
not be and shall not be deemed to have been reinstated or otherwise affected by such
withdrawal, discontinuance or abandomnent, and Trustor hereby expressly waives the
benefit of any statute or rule of law now provided, or which may hereafter be provided,
which would produce a result contrary to, or in conflict with, this paragraph 22.
23. Release. Beneficiary shall cancel this Instrument, or cause this Instrument to be
cancelled by Trustee if required by law, under the circumstances provided for such
cancellation in the Loan Agreement. Trustor shall pay Beneficiary’s and Trustee’s
reasonable costs incurred in canceling this Instrument.
24. Acceleration Upon Default; Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the  
continuance of any Event of Default hereunder, and subject to the terms of the Loan I
Agreement, Beneficiary may declare all the Secured Obligations to be due and payable, I
and the same shall thereupon be and become due and payable without any presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind. After the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Agreement regarding the exercise of remedies, Beneficiary and/or Trustee may do any
one or more of the following:
(a) Either in person or by agent, with or without bringing any action or proceeding,
enter upon and take possession of the Property, or any part thereof, in its own
name, and do any acts which it deems necessary or desirable to preserve the
value, marketability or rentability of the Property, or part thereof or interest
therein, increase the income therefrom or protect the security hereof and, with or
without taking possession of the Property, sue for or otherwise collect the rents,
issues and profits thereof, including those past due and unpaid, and apply the
same in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. The entering upon
and taking possession of the Property, the collection of such rents, issues and
profits and the application thereof as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Event
of Default or the Notice of Event of Default hereunder or invalidate any act done
in response to such Event of Default or pursuant to such Notice of Event of
Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in possession of the Property or the
15
USZOOO 10467360.2

 
collection, receipt and application of rents, issues or profits, Beneficiary and
Trustee shall be entitled to exercise every right provided for in any of the Loan
Documents or by law or in equity upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default hereunder, including the right to exercise any power of
sale set forth in this Instrument;
(b) Commence an action to foreclose this Instrument, or specifically enforce any of
the covenants hereof or cause Trustee to foreclose this Instrument by power of
sale. Should Beneficiary elect to foreclose by exercise of the power of sale herein
contained, Beneficiary shall notify Trustee and shall deposit with Trustee this
Instrument and such Loan Documents and such receipts and evidence of
expenditures made and secured hereby as Trustee may require. Upon receipt of
. such notice from Beneficiary, Trustee shall cause to be recorded, published and
delivered to Trustor such notice of default and election to sell as then required by

limitation, Trustor, Trustee, Beneficiary or any of the Secured Creditors, may
purchase at such sale and Trustor hereby covenants to warrant and defend the title y
of such purchaser or purchasers. After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of
Trustee and of the trust created herein, including costs of evidence of title in l
cormection with sale, Trustee, on behalf of Beneficiary or its assigns, shall apply p
the proceeds of sale to the Secured Obligations in such manner as the Secured I
Creditors shall determine or as required by Applicable Law. Trustee may  
postpone sale of all or any portion of the Property by public announcement at l
such time and place of sale, and from time to time thereafter may postpone such l
sale by public amiouncement at the time fixed by the preceding postponement or  
subsequently noticed sale, and without further notice make such sale at the time p
fixed by the last postponement, or may, in its discretion, give a new notice of sale.  
The power of sale under this Instrument shall not be exhausted by any one or  
more sales (or attempts to sell) as to all or any portion of the Property remaining
unsold, but shall continue unimpaired until all of the Property has been sold by
exercise of the power of sale herein contained and the entire Secured Obligations
have been paid in full.

and are irrevocable by death or otherwise, and are in addition to any and all other
remedies which Beneficiary or Trustee may have at law or in equity; Trustor
agrees that in the event a foreclosure hereunder should be commenced by Trustee,
or his substitute or successor, Beneficiary may at any time before the sale of the
Property direct Trustee to abandon the sale, and may then institute suit for the
collection of the Secured Obligations, and for the foreclosure of this Instrument; it
is further agreed that if Beneficiary should institute a suit for the collection
thereof, and for a foreclosure of this Instrument, that it may at any time before the
entry of a final judgment in said suit dismiss the same, and require Trustee, his

applicable Uniform Commercial Code, including, but not limited to:

Agreement shall control.
27. No Merger.

Instrument shall acquire or shall become vested with the fee title to the Property
or any other estate or interest in the Property, such estates shall not merge as a
result of such acquisition and shall remain separate and distinct from all other
l estates and interests in the Property for all purposes after such acquisition. The
lien and security interest created hereby shall not be destroyed or terminated by
the application of the doctrine of merger, and in such event, Trustee, Beneficiary
or such other person or entity shall continue to have and enjoy all of the rights and
privileges of Trustee or Beneficiary hereunder as to each separate estate unless
and until Trustee or Beneficiary or such other person or entity shall affirmatively
elect in writing to merge such estates.
(b) Upon the foreclosure of the lien created hereby on the Property, as herein
provided, any Leases then existing shall not be destroyed or terminated by
application of the doctrine of merger or by operation of law or as a result of such
foreclosure unless Trustee, Beneficiary or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale shall
so elect by written notice to the lessee in question.
28. Obligations Survive Judgment.
(a) All of the Obligations of Trustor shall survive the entry of any judgment for
foreclosure of this Instrument and shall also survive the entry of any judgment on
the Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, despite the entry of any such judgment, (i) Trustor
shall continue to be bound by all of Trustor’s covenants and promises contained
l 8
US2000 10467360.2

 
in this Instrument and in the other Loan Documents, (ii) this Instrument shall
continue to secure all of Trustor’s Obligations under such promises and
covenants, and (iii) any stuns advanced by Trustee or Beneficiary pursuant to the
provisions of the Loan Agreement or this Instrument or any of the other Loan
Documents (including but not limited to any payments by Beneficiary, or Trustee
on its behalf, of Impositions, expenses of maintenance, repair or preservation of
the Property, costs of insurance incurred by Trustee or Beneficiary pursuant to the
provisions hereof and any other expenses and advances of Trustee or Beneficiary
whatsoever, the reimbursement of which by Trustor is provided for herein or in
any of the other Loan Documents), whether such sums are advanced before or
after the entry of any such judgment, shall be secured by this Instrument and be
deemed to be guaranteed as defined herein.
(b) Notwithstanding the entry of any judgment referred to in the above subparagraph
(a), interest shall continue to accrue after the entry of any such judgment on all of
the Obligations (as defined in the Loan Agreement) at the rate or rates provided
for in the Loan Documents (including any applicable default rate or post maturity
rate) despite any statutory provision with respect to interest rates on judgments,
except to the extent such statutory provision cannot be waived by law, and all
such interest shall continue to be secured by this Instrument.
29. Waiver by Trustor. Trustor hereby waives any right relating to, and Trustor hereby
agrees that Trustor shall not at any time hereafter have or assert any right pertaining to:
the sale of property in the inverse order of alienation, appraisement, valuation, stay,
extension, redemption, the maturing or declaring due of the whole or any part of the
Secured Obligations, notice, subrogation, or abatement, suspension, deferment,
diminution or reduction of any of the Secured Obligations (including set-off), now or
hereafter in force.
30. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the
part of Trustee or Beneficiary in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder
shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default
or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or any partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power or
privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Instrument are cumulative to, and
not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. Whether or not for
additional interest or other consideration paid or payable to any Beneficiary, no
forbearance on the part of any Beneficiary or extension of the time for the payment of the
whole or any part of the Secured Obligations, whether oral or in writing, or any other
indulgence given by any Beneficiary to the Trustor, or to any other party claiming any
interest in or to the Property, shall operate to release or in any mamier affect the original
liability of the Trustor, or the priority of this Instrument or to limit, prejudice or impair
any right of Beneficiary, including, without limitation, the right to realize upon the
security, or any part thereof, for the Secured Obligations, or any of them, notice of any
such extension, forbearance or indulgence being hereby waived by the Trustor and all
those claiming by, through or under the Trustor.
19
USZOOO 10467360.2

 
3 l. Interest. In no event shall the amount of interest (including any fees, commissions and
any other amounts which would constitute interest under applicable law governing the
maximrun interest permitted to be charged) due or payable under the Loan Agreement,
including under the Notes, exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by applicable
law and the interest rate calculated under the terms of the Loan Agreement shall be
calculated accordingly so that such maximum lawful rate is not exceeded. In the event
any such payment of interest in excess of the maximum lawful rate is inadvertently made
by the Trustor or inadvertently received by Beneficiary, then such excess sum shall be
credited as a payment of principal, unless the Trustor shall notify Beneficiary, in writing,
that they elect to have such excess sum returned forthwith. It is the express intent hereof
that the Trustor not pay and the Beneficiary not receive, directly or indirectly in any
manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may legally be paid by the Trustor
under applicable law.
32. Additional Terms. This Instrument shall be subject to such other terms and conditions
as may be set forth in any rider attached hereto.
33. Appointment of Successor Trustee. Beneficiary shall at any time have the irrevocable
right to remove Trustee herein named without notice or cause and to appoint his
successor by an instrument in writing, duly acknowledged, in such form as to entitle such
written instrument to be recorded in the state in which the Property is located. In the
event of the death, incapacity or resignation of the Trustee herein named, Beneficiary
shall have the right to appoint his successor by such written instrument. Any Trustee so
appointed shall be vested with the title to the Property and shall possess all the powers,
duties and obligations herein conferred on Trustee in the same manner and to the same
extent as though he were named herein as Trustee.
34. Trustee Provisions. Trustee accepts the trust hereunder but only upon the terms and
conditions hereof, to all of which Trustor and Beneficiary (by its acceptance hereof`)
agree:
(a) Duties of the Trustee. Trustee undertakes by such acceptance, for the benefit of
Beneficiary, to take such action from time to time for the protection and
enforcement of rights of Beneficiary under this Instrument as may be necessary or

(i) Trustee shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder which might in
its sole judgment involve Trustee in any expense or liability unless Trustee
shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity;
(ii) Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred, Trustee shall not
be obligated to take any action hereunder except for the performance of
such duties as are specifically set forth in this Instrument called to
T1ustee’s attention by Beneficiary and as may be requested from time to
time in writing by Beneficiary;
20
USZOOO 10467360.2

 
(iii) Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of existence of any Event of
Default hereunder or the occurrence or existence of any other event or
condition that may affect Trustee’s obligation to act or refrain from acting,
unless notified hereof in writing by Beneficiary;
(iv) If an Event of Default shall have occurred, Trustee shall exercise such
rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in Trustee by this Instrument

Instrument as Trustee may be directed in writing to exercise by
Beneficiary;
(v) Trustee may at any time request written instructions from Beneficiary with
respect to the interpretation of this Instrument or action to be taken or
suffered or not taken hereunder and may refrain from taking any action
under this Instrument until Trustee shall have received such written
instructions from Beneficiary, and upon receipt of such written
instructions, Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively thereon, and
shall be relieved of any liability whatsoever as a result of acting or
refraining from acting in accordance with such instructions, provided that
if in Trustee’s sole judgment such action or refraining from action might
involve Trustee in any expense or liability for which Trustee shall not
have been adequately indemnified by Beneficiary, Trustee shall be entitled
to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining a
declaration of Trustee’s rights and duties under this Instrument; and
(vi) Trustee shall be protected in acting upon any notice, consent, demand,
statement, note or other paper or document believed by Trustee to be
genuine and to have been signed by the party or parties purporting to sign
the same. Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment, nor for any
act done or step taken or omitted, nor for any mistakes of law or fact, nor
for anything which Trustee may do or refrain from doing in good faith, nor
generally shall Trustee have any accountability hereunder except for
Trustee’s willful default or gross negligence, nor for any action taken or
suffered or not taken in accordance with the written request or instructions
of Beneficiary.
(b) Implied Duties of Trustee. No implied covenants or duties against Trustee shall
be read into this Instrument, but the duties and obligations of Trustee to Trustor
and Beneficiary and to all others shall be determined solely by the express
provisions of this Instrument.
35. Request of Trustor. Trustor requests that a copy of any notice of default and a copy of
any notice of sale be mailed to Trustor at the notice address in paragraph I4, above.
36. Revolving Credit. Trustor acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Loans include the

Trustor, (b) this Instrument secures all advances and readvances of principal under the
Revolving Loans, including Revolving Loan Notes, and (c) this Instrument shall remain
in full force and effect without loss of priority, until the Secured Obligations are paid in
full and all agreements between Trustor and the Lenders under the Loan Agreement for
further advances under the Loans have been terminated (and, to the full extent permitted
by Applicable Law, Trustor hereby waives the operation of any Applicable Law,
statutory or otherwise, having a contrary effect).
37. Beneficiary as Successor Lessee. In the event that the Beneficiary shall succeed to the
rights of Trustor, as "lessee" to the Ground Lease, as referenced in Exhibit "A" of this
Instrument, then pursuant to the terms of this Instrument, and provided that the "lessor"
in said Ground Lease recognizes the Beneficiary as the successor lessee, the Beneficiary
shall be conclusively deemed to have accepted the terms of the said Ground Lease. Any
provision of this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, the Beneficiary shall:
(a) have no obligation to succeed to the rights of Trustor, as lessee under said Ground
Lease, and shall not incur any liability thereunder unless and until it elects to succeed to
such rights; and (b) have no liability for any previous act, omission or default tmder the
said Ground Lease, of any prior "lessee" including, without limitation, the Trustor.
38. Attorney’s Fees. As used throughout this Instrument, "attorney’s fees" shall mean
reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses.
39. Severability. Should any part of this Instrument be declared invalid or void by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not effect the validity of the remaining
provisions hereof, and such remaining provisions shall be deemed to be in full force and
effect.
40. Modification Not to Affect Priority of Lien. This Instrument may be modified in
accordance with the terms thereof from time to time without affecting the lien or priority
of the liens, security interests and encumbrances on the Property created hereby.
41. Counterparts. This Instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such separate counterparts shall together
constitute but one and the same instrument.
42. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence of this Instrument and the performance of each
of the covenants and agreements contained herein.
43. Compliance with Applicable Law. Anything elsewhere herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding,
(a) In the event that any provision in this Instrument shall be inconsistent with any
provision of Oregon law regarding foreclosure (the "Oregon Foreclosure Law"),
the provisions of the Oregon Foreclosure Law shall take precedence over the
provisions of this Instrument, but shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any
22
USZOOO 10467360.2

 
other provision of this Instrument that can be construed in a manner consistent
with Oregon Foreclosure Law; and
(b) If any provision of this Instrument shall grant to Beneficiary (including
Beneficiary acting as a mortgagee-in-possession) or a receiver appointed pursuant
to the provisions of this Instrument, any rights or remedies following the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default which are more
limited than the rights that would otherwise be vested in Beneficiary or such
receiver under the Oregon Foreclosure Law in the absence of said provision,
Beneficiary and such receiver shall be vested with the rights granted under the
Oregon Foreclosure Law to the full extent permitted by law.
44. Cross Collateralization; Cross Default. Trustor acknowledges that the Secured
Obligations are secured by, among other things, this Instrument together with additional
mortgages, Instruments, deeds of trust or similar security instruments, as the case may be,
all as more specifically set forth in the Loan Agreement and Loan Documents (together
with their respective assigmnents of leases and rents and other documents securing or
evidencing the Secured Obligations (the "Additional Security Instruments") and
encumbering the additional properties (the "Additiona1 Properties"), all as more
specifically set forth in the Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Beneficiary shall have the right to institute a
proceeding or proceedings for the total or partial foreclosure of this Instrument and any or (
all of the Additional Security Instruments whether by court action, power of sale or
otherwise, under any applicable provision of law, for all of the Secured Obligations or the
portion of the Secured Obligations allocated to the land and premises in the Loan
Agreement, and the lien and the security interest created by the Additional Security
Instruments shall continue in full force and effect without loss of priority as a lien and
security interest securing the payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations then due
and payable but still outstanding. Trustor acknowledges and agrees that the land and
premises and the Additional Properties are located in one or more states and counties, and
therefore Beneficiary shall be permitted to enforce payment of the Secured Obligations
and the performance of any term, covenant or condition of this Instrument, the Loan
Agreement, the Loan Documents, or the Additional Security Instruments and exercise
any and all rights and remedies under this Instrument, the Loan Agreement, the Loan
Documents or the Additional Security Instruments, or as provided by law or at equity, by
one or more proceedings, whether contemporaneous, consecutive or both, to be
determined by Beneficiary, in its sole discretion, in any one or more of the States or
counties in which the Property or any Additional Property is located. Neither the
acceptance of this Instrument, the Loan Agreement, the Loan Documents or the
Additional Security Instruments nor the enforcement thereof in any one state or county,
whether by court action, foreclosure, power of sale or otherwise, shall prejudice or in any
way limit or preclude enforcement by court action, foreclosure, power of sale or
otherwise, of this Instrument, the Loan Agreement, the Loan Documents or any
Additional Security Instruments through one or more additional proceedings in that state
or county or in any other state or county. Any and all sums received by Beneficiary
23
USZOOO 10467360.2

 
under this Instrument and the Loan Agreement shall be applied to the Secured
Obligations in the order set forth in the Loan Agreement.
45. Venue. TRUSTOR HEREBY CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT THE STATE OR
FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL HAVE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR
DISPUTES BETWEEN TRUSTOR AND BENEFICIARY PERTAINING TO THIS
INSTRUMENT OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS INSTRUMENT; PROVIDED, THAT BENEFICIARY AND TRUSTOR
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY APPEALS FROM THOSE COURTS MAY HAVE
TO BE HEARD BY A COURT LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK; PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT NOTHING IN THIS INSTRUMENT
SHALL BE DEEMED OR OPERATE TO PRECLUDE BENEFICIARY FROM
BRINGING SUIT OR TAKING OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION TO COLLECT THE OBLIGATIONS, TO REALIZE ON THE
COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR
TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF
BENEFICIARY; AND FURTHER PROVIDED, THAT ALL ACTIONS OR
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE CREATION,
PERFECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE LIEN CREATED BY THIS
INSTRUMENT SHALL BE LITIGATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

MAY HAVE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION,
IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM _N_QN CONVENIENS. TRUSTOR HEREBY
WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS, COMPLAINT AND
OTHER PROCESS ISSUED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR SUIT AND AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINTS AND OTHER
PROCESS MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL
ADDRESSED TO TRUSTOR AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE LOAN
AGREEMENT AND THAT SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED
COMPLETED UPON THE EARLIER OF TRUSTOR’S ACTUAL RECEIPT
THEREOF OR FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER DEPOSIT IN THE U.S.
MAILS, PROPER POSTAGE PREPAID.
46. Jury Trial Waiver. BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH I
COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND  
ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT l
PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL
LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES
DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING
SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST
COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OF
ARBITRATION, Trustor, AND BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS INSTRUMENT,
BENEFICIARY, HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
24

RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP, COURSE OF
DEALINGS OR COURSE OF CONDUCT ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM IN

HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY REQUIREMENT OR
OBLIGATION THAT BENEFICIARY OR TRUSTEE PRESENT EVIDENCE OR
OTHERWISE PROCEED BEFORE ANY COURT, CLERK, OR OTHER
JUDICIAL OR QUASIJUDICIAL BODY BEFORE EXERCISE OF THE
POWERS OF SALE CONTAINED IN THIS DEED OF TRUST AND IN THE

LEASEHOLD RIDER
(Deed of Trust)
l. This Instrument constitutes an encumbrance against the Leasehold Premises and
leasehold estate of Trustor (collectively and as defined hereinabove, the "Leasehold Property")
pursuant to the Ground Lease (as defined hereinabove) described in Exhibit "A" hereinafter set
forth in this Instrument and incorporated herein. All references to the “Property" in this
Instrument shall refer to the Leasehold Premises of Trustor under the Ground Lease.
(a) With respect to the Ground Lease, Trustor hereby represents, covenants
and warrants that: (i) the Ground Lease is in full force and effect and unmodified, except
as set forth herein; (ii) all rents (including additional rents and other charges) reserved in
the Ground Lease and all services or other consideration to be provided or paid under the
Grotmd Lease have been paid or provided to the extent they were payable or required
prior to the date hereof; (iii) there is no existing material default under the provisions of
the Ground Lease or in the performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions, or
warranties thereof on the part of Trustor; and (iv) except as previously disclosed in
writing to Beneficiary (and excluding all leases of space on any tower, in any equipment
shelter and/or for any equipment building or back-up generator pad located on the
Property), Trustor has not sublet the Leasehold Property or assigned the Ground Lease.
(b) Trustor shall at all times promptly comply with the terms and conditions
of the Ground Lease in all material respects. Trustor covenants that it will not act or fail
to act so as to impair the security of this Instrument or constitute a material default of the
Ground Lease. If Trustor shall fail prior to the expiration of any applicable notice or
grace period (if any) under the Ground Lease, to fully perform and comply with all
agreements, covenants, terms and conditions imposed upon or assumed by it as tenant
under the Ground Lease, then, upon the happening of any such event, without limiting the  
generality of any other provision of this Instrument or any remedy of Beneficiary or I
Trustee hereunder or otherwise available to Beneficiary or Trustee and without waiving
or releasing Trustor from any of its obligations hereunder, Beneficiary may (but shall not
be obligated to) take any action Beneficiary deems necessary or desirable to prevent or to
cure any default by Trustor in the performance of or compliance with any of Trustor’s
covenants or obligations under the Ground Lease. Trustor shall provide Beneficiary
prompt written notice of any notice of default or breach Trustor receives from the
landlord with respect to the Ground Lease. Upon receipt by Beneficiary from Trustor or
the landlord under the Ground Lease of any written notice of default by tenant
thereunder, Beneficiary may rely thereon and take any action, as aforesaid, to cure such
default even though the existence of such default or the nature thereof be questioned or
denied by Trustor or by any party on behalf of Trustor.
(c) If both the landlord’s and tenant’s estates under the Ground Lease or any
portion thereof shall at any time become vested in one owner, this Instrument and the lien
and interest created hereby shall not be destroyed or terminated by application of the
doctrine of merger. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, upon the foreclosure
US2000 10467360.2

l
i of the lien and interest created by this Instrument pursuant to the provisions hereof, any
leases or subleases then existing and created by Trustor shall not be destroyed or
terminated by application of the law of merger or as a matter of law or as a result of such
foreclosure unless Beneficiary or Trustee or any purchaser at any such foreclosure sale
shall so elect. No act by or on behalf of Beneficiary or Trustee or any such purchaser
shall constitute a termination of any lease or sublease unless Beneficiary or such
purchaser shall give written notice thereof to such tenant or subtenant. Trustor further
covenants and agrees that, in case it shall acquire the fee title, or any other estate, title or
interest in the Leasehold Premises covered by the Ground Lease, including, without
limitation, pursuant to the purchase option or right of first refusal, if any, set forth in the
Ground Lease, this Instrument shall attach to or cover and be a lien and interest upon
such other estate so acquired, and such other estate so acquired by Trustor shall be
considered as granted, bargained, sold, transferred, assigned or conveyed to Trustee, for
the benefit of Beneficiary, and the lien and interest hereof shall include such estate with
the same force and effect as though specifically herein granted, bargained, sold,
transferred, assigned or conveyed.
2. The lien and interest created by this Instrument in and to the Ground Lease and
the Property shall create no estate or title in Beneficiary greater than that vested in Trustor under
` the Ground Lease.
3. Trustor shall not be obligated under this Instrument to perform any of landlord’s y
maintenance or other obligations with respect to the Property which are set forth in the Ground l
Lease.
4. Trustee’s and Beneficiary’s remedies (if any) against the landlord under the
Ground Lease, with respect to the Property and possession thereof, shall be subject to the terms
of the Ground Lease and applicable law.
5. Trustor has obtained all necessary consents and approvals from the landlord under
the Ground Lease to permit the lien and interest created by this Instrument.
