this Deed of Trust to the interest rate which Lender would then commit to make a first mortgage loan of similar character with

Property (all such leases and agreements whether written or oral, are hereafter referred to as the "Leases"), and all guaranties
of lessees' performance under the Leases, together with the immediate and continuing right to collect and receive all ofthe
rents, income, receipts, revenues, issues, profits and other income of any nature now or hereafter due (including any income
I of any nature coming due during any redemption period) under the Leases or from or arising out ofthe Property, including
minimum rents, additional rents, percentage rents, parking or common area maintenance contributions, tax and insurance

this assignment is intended to be specific, perfected, and choate upon the recording of this Deed of Trust, all as provided in

Property, and Lender shall have full power to periodically make alterations, renovations, repairs or replacements to the

properly insured and may discharge any taxes, charges, claims, assessments and other liens which may accrue. The expense
and cost of these actions may be paid from the Rents received, and any unpaid amounts shall be added to the principal ofthe
Obligations. These amounts, together with other costs, shall become part ofthe Obligations secured by this Deed of Trust.

not a default exlsts under this Deed of Trust. Grantor shall diligently collect the Indebtedness owing to Grantor from these
third parties until the giving of such notification. ln the event that Grantor possesses or receives possession of any instruments
or other remittances with respect to the Indebtedness following the giving of such n tification or if the instruments or other
remittances constitute the prepayment of any Indebtedness or the payment of argyginsurance or condemnation proceeds,
Grantor shall hold such instruments and other remittances in trust for Lender apart from its other property, endorse the
instruments and other remittances to Lender, and immediately provide Lender with possession of the instruments and other
