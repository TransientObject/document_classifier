Instrument cannot be lawfully secured hereby, payments in reduction of such sums shall be applied first to those y

permitted to be collected is interpreted so that any charge provided for in this Security Instrument or in the Note, l
whether considered separately or together with other charges that are considered
a part of this Security Instrument and Note transaction, violates such law by reason, such charge is hereby ,
reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate such violation. The amounts of such interest or other charges

maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to y
be collected in connection with the loan exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be
reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected `
, from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this
refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund
reduces
principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge under the Note.
15. Borrower’s Authorization for Disclosure of Financial Information. Borrower hereby authorizes
the holder of any mortgage, deed of trust or other encumbrance with a lien that has a priority over this Security
Instrument to disclose any financial information requested in writing by the above-named Lender regarding
Borrower’s loan. Such information may include, but shall not be limited to, the following information: current
loan balance, loan status, delinquency notices, tax and insurance receipts, hazard insurance policies and flood
insurance policies, and any other information deemed necessary in its sole discretion by Lender.
To the extent the lender may elect to do so, from time to time, the Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to
cure wholly or in part any default or failure of performance under the terms of the prior Note and Security
Instrument. The Borrower hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless any Lender acting in reliance upon
this provision from any and all liability and causes of action arising from actions taken pursuant to this provision,
including, but not limited to. all attorney fees, costs and expenses incurred for any reason. This provision cannot
be amended, revoked, superseded, or canceled prior to payment in full of the subordinate debt without the
express written consent of the Lender. This provision of the Security Instrument may be continually used from
time to time, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lender, its successors and assigns.
16. Wavier of Notice of Intention and Accelerate. Borrower waives the right to notice of intention to _
require payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument except as provided in paragraph 7.
